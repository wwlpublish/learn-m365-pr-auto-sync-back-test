In recent years, malicious attacks on applications such as browsers and document readers have become more common and keeping up with new threats is even harder. Software isolation seeks to contain the damage in the event an application is successfully compromised by an exploit. 

Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Defender Application Guard (formerly Windows Defender Application Guard [WDAG]) combine for both a software and hardware isolation approach to security. This approach lets untrusted sites launch inside a container and the isolation helps enterprises safeguard their corporate network and data in case the site users visited is compromised or is malicious. Microsoft Edge provides the highest level of protection against zero-day exploits, unpatched vulnerabilities, and web-based malware. 

Check out the video below to see how Microsoft Edge isolates processes to prevent malicious attacks and unauthorized access through the browser.

As you just saw in the video, you can use Process Explorer to visualize how Microsoft Edge isolates processes to maintain a secure browsing environment. When sandboxes are in place, malicious code delivered by a successful application exploit is restricted from accessing data and resources on the host operating system.

A key security strategy to consider is the [Assume Breach Methodology](/office365/Enterprise/office-365-monitoring-and-testing#assume-breach-methodology), which means there's an acceptance that an attack is going to succeed at least once regardless of efforts to prevent it. This mindset requires building defenses to contain the damage, which ensures that corporate network and other resources remain protected in this scenario. Using Application Guard with Microsoft Edge fits right into this strategy.
