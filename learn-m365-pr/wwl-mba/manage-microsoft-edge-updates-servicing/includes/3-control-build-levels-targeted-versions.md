New ADMX-based policies allow IT administrators to limit Microsoft Edge to specific, targeted versions. This approach allows for greater control by letting organizations test specific builds before deploying to more users.  Administrators can download the new ADMX policies at [https://aka.ms/edgeenterprise](https://aka.ms/edgeenterprise).

As you saw, you can limit the build level of Microsoft Edge to specific versions using the new ADMX-based policies.
