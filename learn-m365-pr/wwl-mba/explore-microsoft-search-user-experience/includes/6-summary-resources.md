Microsoft Search supports secure search of your intranet and web content. This type of integration across the web and organizations is only available from Microsoft. 

Microsoft Search is built into the new Microsoft Edge.  Rich search experiences that work from the Microsoft Edge browser on your PC also work from the Edge browser on your mobile devices.  

Devices configured with Google Chrome can also take advantage of the power of Microsoft Search, with some basic provisioning to install the appropriate extension and enable Bing as the default search engine.
