You work for Woodgrove, a large financial organization. Your organization's technical director shared a report about the company's internal IT infrastructure. The report reveals that although your company's production environment runs on Windows 10, 20% of Windows 10 devices have reached end of service or are nearing end of service. As a result, some devices that perform critical business functions are not receiving security updates and are at greater risk of obtaining viruses and malware. In addition, these devices might miss out on important feature updates to build on productivity across the organization.

You've been asked to present a plan for how your company can stay current with the latest Windows updates from Microsoft. In this module, you'll learn how you can use the Windows servicing process to help your organization implement a plan to stay current with the latest Windows updates. By the end of this module you'll understand the servicing process, and understand how to plan to stay current.
