For your next step, you need your management and team members on your side. Getting buy-in from your organization's key stakeholders is necessary to implement SharePoint Syntex. Companies thrive when all the necessary parties are aligned on how they can use SharePoint Syntex to improve their organization's content understanding processes.

Here, you'll learn which stakeholders you should approach with your proposal for adopting SharePoint Syntex.  

## Executive/Leadership

"Buy-in" or _endorsement_ at the executive level ensure that all other stakeholders are invested in SharePoint Syntex and aligned on the greater goal or mission of implementing efficient content understanding processes. Leadership already has a clear idea the company's goals and values, enabling them to see how SharePoint Syntex aligns with these goals. Much of the company looks to the executive team for direction and trusts their buy-in, making it easier to adopt and support SharePoint Syntex throughout the entire company.  

You may make your proposal to your CEO or Chief Operating Officer, or the corresponding role. depending on your organization's size. (For example, it might be the IT administrator you pitch your proposal to.) With the executive team's endorsement and support, SharePoint Syntex is one major step closer to implementation.

Once your leadership team is onboard with your SharePoint Syntex strategy, they can begin speaking to the rest of your company about SharePoint Syntex's benefits.

## Champions

Product champions _advocate_ for a SharePoint Syntex rollout. Champions drive other stakeholders forward and help build content understanding processes into your organization, making them an accepted norm.  

Your SharePoint Syntex champions need a basic understanding of how the solution works. They need to understand why implementing SharePoint Syntex makes sense for your company. This understanding enables them to answer questions or objections from other members of your organization. Change can be met with questioning, so being able to meet these questions with answers and a clear understanding is crucial.  

As a best practice, all your stakeholders should ideally be champions. Executives, project leads, knowledge admins, and model owners are close enough to the initiative that they can actively endorse rollout. However, based on your scenario at Contoso Electronics, the Sales team, who stand to benefit from the results of a SharePoint Syntex rollout, might be your ultimate champions.  

When you have your leadership team onboard and champions evangelizing for SharePoint Syntex, you're ready to present your proposal to the next critical set of stakeholders: project leads.

## Project leads

Project leads are the people or teams that manage the _deployment_ of SharePoint Syntex. They need a solid understanding of why the organization's adopting SharePoint Syntex. They need to know what it takes to make that happen. Project leads help identify all the other stakeholders and bring them into communication channels. As the project gets underway, the project lead makes certain that identified roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. A project lead needs to be familiar with project management and have an all-encompassing view of your organization's structure.

So far, you've been acting as project lead. Once your proposal to use SharePoint Syntex to organize your company's content libraries gets the green light, you might decide to pass the project lead baton to someone from your project management team.
