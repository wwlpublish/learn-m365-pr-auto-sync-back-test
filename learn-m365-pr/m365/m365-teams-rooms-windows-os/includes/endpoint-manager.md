Microsoft Endpoint Manager is a unified platform including both on-premises Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune. You can secure, deploy, and manage all users, apps, and devices without disruption to existing processes, bringing together several cloud and on-premises services into a single Management Portal.

## Configuration Manager

Configuration Manager is an on-premises tool to manage devices. Does it make sense to use Configuration Manager to manage Teams Rooms devices?

Ultimately, this depends upon your environment, what your current processes and procedures look like, and how well they're managed. The main benefit of Configuration Manager is inventorying Teams Rooms devices and configuring settings for things like Microsoft Defender.

## Microsoft Intune

Intune features modernize Windows 10 management without compromising control. You get the most integrated and complete device management, app lifecycle management, and user provisioning capabilities for Windows 10.

With Intune, you can package applications to deploy to devices, enable BitLocker, and manage Windows firewall. You can also do inventorying and reporting of Teams Rooms devices.

There are a couple of ways to enroll Teams Rooms devices into Intune. One way is by using the Windows Settings app. Another is to use Azure AD auto-enrollment.
