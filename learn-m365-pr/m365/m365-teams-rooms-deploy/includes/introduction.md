**Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms** covers a few different disciplines. You'll  learn how you can standardize Teams Rooms deployments to simplify the distribution of Teams Rooms across your environment. This includes things like shipping, components, and logistics.

You'll learn how the various components of Teams Rooms connect with one another. How does a table microphone connect to the compute module? How do simple room configurations differ from complex room configurations?
