        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Each policy template is based on specific indicators (that can be turned off or on) that correspond to particular risk activities. Alerts are triggered by policies when users perform activities related to these indicators. "
      - content: "Policy timeframes"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Depending on the template, you select the timeframes available are activation window and past activity detection."
      - content: "Intelligent detections"
        isCorrect: false

      choices:
      - content: "Departing employee’s data theft template"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "If you configure a policy using the Departing employee data theft template, you'll need to configure a Microsoft 365 HR data connector so that you can import user and log data from 3rd-party risk management and human resources platforms. HR connectors allow you to pull in human resources data from CSV files, including user termination and last employment dates. "
      - content: "Data leaks "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "If you configure a policy using the Data leaks template, you'll need to configure at least one data loss prevention (DLP) policy to use the full signal detection features of the policy template.  An HR data connector is not needed. "
      - content: "Offensive language in email "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "There is no dependency on an HR data connector for the offensive language in email template. Detecting and taking action to prevent offensive and abusive behavior is a critical component of preventing risk. Built-in offensive language classifiers in Microsoft 365 can scan sent email messages from Exchange Online mailboxes in your organization for different types of compliance issues. "
