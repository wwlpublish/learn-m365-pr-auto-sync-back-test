After broad deployment, the cycle is almost complete. As the process manager, you'll propose how your team can ensure its environment is positioned better for the next update, and that it can deploy updates more efficiently.

## Capture learnings

You should think about how you can improve the servicing process for the next deployment cycle. This procedure will help your organization minimize cost, effort, and the time involved when deploying updates.

To improve the deployment process, you can use learnings from the current deployment cycle and apply them in the future. You do this by noting any issues in the deployment process as they arise, and investigating how they can be resolved. You use the outputs created at the end of the broad deployment process to identify the best tools and ways to resolve issues. You can then map tools, resources, and solutions against the issues identified during the process. For example:

|Workstream  |Issue  |Solution  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Compatibility     |Manual testing takes longer than anticipated|Your team can use automated testing wherever possible to reduce the time it takes to carry out tests|
|Deployment     |Deferring the update for some devices requires much manual work and tracking|Windows Update for Business can make it easier to defer updates across many devices |
|Capability and modernization     |Difficult to add new devices to the production environment by creating and customizing images|Your team can use Windows Autopilot to configure new devices in a much more simplified way|
