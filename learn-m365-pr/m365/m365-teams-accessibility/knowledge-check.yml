 # Question 2

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The **Set-CsTeamsBlurMeetingPolicy** cmdlet doesn't exist, so you can't use it to create a policy. You also must use the `VideoFiltersMode` parameter to successfully apply a blur policy.

    - content: Make sure to create a meeting using the **Set-CsTeamsMeeting** cmdlet and set the `-BlurFiltersMode` parameter to **BlurOnly**.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The BlurFiltersMode parameter doesn't exist, so you can't use it to enable blurring. Also, you don't create a meeting using a cmdlet, you need to create a policy.

 # Question 4
  - content: Normally, when a meeting participant shares their screen, all participants video streams convert to a thumbnail. This could be a problem for users who need interpreters because they need to be able to clearly see their interpreters. How can those users resolve this?
    choices:
    - content: They can pin the video of the interpreters.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: The interpreter will continue to be displayed at an easily viewable size while displaying the remaining screen space with the rest of the video.
    - content: They can use the Raise your hand feature.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Raise your hand feature gives users the chance to speak, it doesn't ensure interpreters can be viewable. Instead, they should pin the video of the interpreters.
    - content: They can use Together mode.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Together mode will put display all participants in single, shared space. It doesn't ensure interpreters are fully viewable. Instead, they should pin the video of the interpreters.
