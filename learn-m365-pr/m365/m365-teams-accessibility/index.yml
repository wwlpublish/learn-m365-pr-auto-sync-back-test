title: Configure Microsoft Teams meetings and calls for inclusion
summary: As a Microsoft Teams admin, you want Teams to be as inclusive of people with disabilities as possible. According to the WHO, 1 billion people in the world have a disability. Additionally, much of disability is invisible, like hearing loss, dyslexia, and autism. You will want to proactively consider these users with disabilities as you make decisions about your Teams environment. Microsoft Teams includes numerous features--including captioning of live video, real-time transcription of meetings, support for sign-language interpreters, adaptive backgrounds, and in-meeting chat that give your users a great amount of flexibility in how they engage with your Teams environment. In this module, we'll look at how to enable Teams to make your environment more flexible--and more inclusive.
