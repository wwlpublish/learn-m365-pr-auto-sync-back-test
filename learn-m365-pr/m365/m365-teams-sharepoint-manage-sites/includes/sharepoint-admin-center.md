Site management takes place in the SharePoint admin center.  The **Active sites** page of the SharePoint admin center lets you view the SharePoint sites in your organization, including communication sites and sites that belong to Office 365 Groups. It also lets you sort and filter sites, search for a site, and create new sites.

From the admin center, you can:

- **Create a site.** From here, you can create a team site (which will create an Office 365 Group) or a communication site.

- **Delete a site.** Global administrators and SharePoint administrators can delete sites. Deleting sites that are associated with an Office 365 Group will delete the group and all its resources, including the Outlook mailbox and calendar, and any Teams channels.
- **Add or remove owners.** For a group-connected team site, you can add and remove group owners. For other sites, you can change the primary administrator and add or remove other administrators.
- **Change a site's hub site association.** The hub site menu lets you register a site as a hub site, associate it with a hub site, change its hub site association, and unregister it as a hub site.
- **Change the external sharing setting for a site.** Allows you to configure if users can share files, folders, and the site externally.
- **View site details.** Click the site name to open the **Details** pane.
- **Switch views and create custom views.** The SharePoint admin center comes with a few built-in views: Office 365 Group sites, Sites without a group, Largest sites, Least active sites, and Most popular shared sites. You can also create and save custom views.
