Today, analyst firms report that the average enterprise’s employees collectively use more than 300 software-as-a-service applications (and some estimates are much higher). That number is rapidly expanding. Between the hyper-growth of these apps, the rate at which they change and the business demand to harness new cloud capabilities for business transformation, it’s challenging to keep up. Relying on an on-premises identity solution as the control point makes connecting to all these cloud applications a nearly impossible task. If you include all the user devices, guest accounts, and connected objects,  you have a management and security nightmare.
