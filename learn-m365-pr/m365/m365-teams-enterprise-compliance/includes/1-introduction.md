There are a range of tools and features in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to help you ensure that your Microsoft Teams usage complies with government and industry regulations and standards.

Suppose you are the lead administrator for a firm of legal advisors. You'll work strictly to the data protection regulations that are in force in your jurisdiction to guarantee the reputation of your company. You've recently rolled out Teams and you're using it for project management, file management, conferencing, and chats. Your management is pleased with the streamlined communications you've achieved but they want reassurance that you can continue to comply with legal requirements. You want to investigate and, if necessary, enforce compliance in Teams.

In this module, you'll look at the features you can use to protect your data and follow the relevant regulations for your industry. The features include:

- Data retention policies
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies
- Information barrier policies
- Communication compliance for channels, chats, and attachments
- eDiscovery and legal hold for channels, chats, and files

- Describe how to configure data retention and data loss prevention policies.
