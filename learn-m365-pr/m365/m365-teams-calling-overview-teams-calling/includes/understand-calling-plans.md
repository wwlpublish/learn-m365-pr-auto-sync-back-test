All calls made to other Teams users (and Skype for Business users) are free. However, external calls incur charges.  If you don't wish to use Direct Routing through your on-premises telephony infrastructure, you can use Calling Plan. With Calling Plan, Microsoft provides the service to the public telephone network through Office 365, and no extra PSTN carrier is involved.

## What is a calling plan?

A calling plan is a license that combines a user's phone number with many minutes. Each phone number requires a calling plan.

Two types of calling plan are available:

- **Domestic Calling Plan**. This calling plan enables a user to place calls outside of the organization to telephone numbers located in the same country/region in which they are assigned in Office 365 or Microsoft 365.
- **Domestic and International Calling Plan**. This plan allows a user to make domestic calls to other numbers located in their country/region, and to international phone numbers.

A calling plan includes a number of pre-paid minutes. Once the minutes in a calling plan have been exhausted, calls are charged on a per-minute basis. All users in the same country/region that have the same calling plan pool their minutes. For example, 100 users in the same country/region that each have a domestic calling plan with 120 minutes each, have access to a shared pool of 12,000 minutes in total.

An administrator can purchase a calling plan using the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. You can buy different calling plans and assign them to users as appropriate, depending on their requirements.
