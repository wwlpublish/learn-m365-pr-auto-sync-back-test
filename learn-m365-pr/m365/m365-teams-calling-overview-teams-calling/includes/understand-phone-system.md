Microsoft Teams Phone acts like a virtual PBX for your business. You can use it in place of an on-premises PBX to connect to the PSTN. Internal calls are routed through Phone System and do not reach the PSTN. This includes long-distance calls between offices in different regions.

> [!NOTE]
> In some countries and regions, it's illegal to bypass the PSTN provider to decrease long-distance calling costs. Location-Based Routing for Direct Routing enables you to restrict toll bypass for Microsoft Teams users based on their geographic location. For more information, read [Plan Location-Based Routing for Direct Routing]( /microsoftteams/location-based-routing-plan).

## Calling users

Phone System is integrated with Teams and Office 365. To make a call, a user can select a name from their address book and click. Phone System users can place calls using a mobile device, a laptop or PC, or any of the IP phones that can operate with Teams.

A Phone System administrator can control and manage calling options for other users.

Phone System supports voicemail. When you assign a Phone System license and a phone number to a user, Cloud Voicemail is automatically provisioned for that user.
You can also configure call queuing to enable calls to be answered by one of a pool of users, such as an agent in a call center. Callers are placed on hold and listen to music or a pre-recorded message until an agent is available. It's possible to set up multiple queues in an organization.

Auto attendants enable you to create a custom phone menu system for your organization. You can configure a system that directs or transfers internal and external callers to the most appropriate department or user within your organization.

## Features of Phone System

Additional features of Phone System include:

- **Music on hold**. Default music is played when an external call received from the PSTN is placed on hold. An administrator can configure this feature using PowerShell.
- **Initiate calls by name or number**. A user can place a call either by entering their number or selecting their name from a list of contacts.
- **Call forwarding**. Users can set up forwarding rules to redirect calls to another number, or directly to voicemail.
- **Group call pickup**. You can define groups of numbers for colleagues working in the same area. Any member of the group can answer a call directed to a member of that group. This feature is useful if a colleague is away or otherwise occupied.
- **Call transfer**. A call can be easily transferred to another user. Alternatively, you can transfer a call to a different device (such as a mobile phone) if you want to continue a call but leave your desk.
- **Caller ID**. Calls from internal users can display information retrieved from the corporate directory (such as name, photo, and job title) rather than simply the phone number. If a caller is external, information provided by the Caller ID service of the phone provider can be displayed.
- **Make and receive video calls**. If enabled for a user that has a camera attached to their device, the user can make face-to-face video calls.
