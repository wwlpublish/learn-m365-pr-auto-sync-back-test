## When not to choose Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop isn't suited for offline scenarios. It runs on Azure in the cloud. Users need to be online to connect and use Azure Virtual Desktop remote apps and desktops.

## Is Azure Virtual Desktop the right choice?

Let's reconsider our accounting firm scenario from the first unit. The key points from that scenario were:

- Users need to be able to work from any device from anywhere.
- During tax season, short-term employees are hired to be able to meet customer needs and tax deadlines.
- Tax software changes from year to year and the organization has some legacy applications that are a challenge to support.
- You need to provide a secure, consistent, and performant experience to the apps employees need to do their work.

Azure Virtual Desktop can support all these scenarios and would be a good choice for this organization.
