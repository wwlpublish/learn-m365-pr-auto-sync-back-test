Even if you've invested in quality cameras or vision mixers to produce custom video broadcasts, poor quality audio can still let you down. If attendees can't hear you, they  become disengaged and uninterested. You've invested much time in the video for your upcoming company-wide meeting, and now you want to make sure the sound is high quality as well.

## Common sound problems

A microphone is a device that senses sound and converts it into an electrical signal. A sound card is a device that converts that analog signal into a digital waveform that your computer can handle. You need both a mic and a sound card in order to input audio into Teams or any other application.

Most laptops and mobile devices include a microphone and a sound card, but they may be cheap and produce poor quality sound. Desktop computers may also have such devices built into the screen or installed as separate peripherals. Low-quality sound can be distracting and fatiguing to listen to for long periods. If you want to present a professional meeting, webinar, or live event, consider investing in good quality audio hardware and setting it up well.

Audio problems in online meetings often include:

- **Distortion.** If your mic picks up only a narrow range of frequencies or if the sound is too loud for your mic, your speech will be distorted and may be difficult to understand.
- **Feedback.** If the sound of the meeting is picked up by the microphone, it can result in feedback loops, which sound like infinite echoes.
- **Hum.** If your mains supply is not properly isolated from your audio equipment, it can cause a distracting hum for listeners.
- **Mobile phone interference.** Mobile phones cause electrical interference when they contact a transmitter, which your microphone may pick up.
- **Echoes and reverberations.** If your room is reverberant, it can be distracting.

With good equipment choices and careful setup, you can avoid all these problems.

## Choose audio equipment

For the best audio quality, use a separate, dedicated microphone on its own stand. If you expect to have to move around a studio during the presentation, you can choose a lapel mic, also known as a lavalier microphone, which clips to your clothing.

Choose a good quality sound card, which usually connects your computer via USB. Make sure that it has the correct input plug. For example, expensive mics often use an XLR plug, and if you don't have an XLR socket on your sound card, you'll need an adapter.

Some USB mics have the sound card built into them. Once you've connected them to your computer and drivers have been installed, they should appear as a separate sound device to select in Teams.

If you want to work with multiple microphones, for example if you're producing an event with two or more presenters in the same room, you might need an audio mixer. This device is a sound card with multiple inputs and hardware mixing controls, much like the sound mixers used in the music industry. Audio mixers often connect to your computer through a USB connection.

If you have persistent noise or hum on your audio, you may have a ground loop. Ground loops occur when there are multiple paths to electrical grounds and small differences in the potential of those grounds. A ground loop isolator can solve these issues by blocking direct current and low frequency alternating current.

## Audio equipment setup

Firstly, before you set up your equipment, listen to the sound in your room: Are there any distracting noises, such as machinery or fans? Are there air conditioning units? Are your colleagues using radios or listening to music? Eliminate these noises or move to a quieter location.

If you're at home, make sure that you won't be disturbed by family members or pets.
For the best quality sound, use a mic stand to place your microphone around six to 12 inches from your mouth. This position will minimize the reverberations from the walls and ceiling of your room. However, when the mic is close to your mouth, you may hear distortion when you make plosive sounds, such as "P" and "B". To prevent plosive distortion, use a pop shield between your mouth and the microphone. Shock mounts are also useful, because they reduce noise transmitted up the mic stand, for example if you knock the stand with your hand. Some quality microphone kits include pop shields and shock mounts.

> Remember, if you will be sharing video of your face, make sure that the microphone doesn't block your camera's view.

If you don't need your mobile phone or tablet during the presentation, turn it off or remove it from the room to prevent interference. Alternatively, you can switch it to airplane mode. In this mode, a mobile phone generates no interference but can't access the network so make sure you have loaded any web pages or other content before you switch to airplane mode.
