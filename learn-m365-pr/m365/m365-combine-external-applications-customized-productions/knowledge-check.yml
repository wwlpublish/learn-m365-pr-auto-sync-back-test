  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Your attendees complain that they hear distortion when you pronounce 'P' and 'B' sounds. What should you use to solve this problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "A ground loop isolator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. Use a ground loop isolator to reduce hum and other persistent noise."
    - content: "A pop shield"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A pop shield reduces the distortion associated with plosive sounds, such as 'P' and 'B'."
    - content: "A shock mount"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. Use a shock mount to reduce noise transmitted through the mic stand, such as when you know the stand with your hand."
  - content: "You want to moderate the questions and answers during a live event. Which of these roles should the meeting organizer assign to you?"
    choices:
    - content: "Presenter"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Live event presenters can also moderate the questions and answers."
    - content: "Producer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. Live event producers can start and stop the event, share video, and select layouts but can't moderate questions and answers."
    - content: "Attendee"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. Live event attendees can view the event and ask questions but can't moderate questions and answers."
  - content: "You want to use NDI to broadcast meeting video stream to a vision mixer over the network but you can't see the Network Device Interface (NDI) setting in Teams options. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Check that administrators have enabled NDI in the Teams meeting policy."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A Teams administrator must use the Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy PowerShell cmdlet to enable NDI in the policy, before you see the option in Teams."
    - content: "Start the meeting and select Broadcast over NDI in More Options."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. If you can't see the Network Device Interface (NDI) setting in Teams options, the Broadcast over NDI option won't appear in the meeting."
    - content: "Sign out and start the meeting as a guest user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. If the option is unavailable for authenticated users, it won't be available for guests either."
