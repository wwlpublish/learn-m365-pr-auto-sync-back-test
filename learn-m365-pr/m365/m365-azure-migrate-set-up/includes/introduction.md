In the previous module of this Learning Path, we discussed the options for migrating your VMware infrastructure to Azure and the seven steps involved in the Azure Migrate option. In this module, we explore the first two steps of Azure Migrate in more detail:

1. **Set up prerequisites and ensure both environments have the needed permissions.**
1. **Set up an Azure Migrate project, including the tools for assessment and migration.**
1. Download a virtual machine appliance and deploy it in VMware environment to discover virtual machines and dependencies.
1. Review the assessment and dependencies from Azure Migrate while scoping the target migration.
1. Replicate virtual machines from VMware into Azure storage.
1. Test virtual machines using a test virtual network.
1. Migrate virtual machines into production using a production virtual network.
