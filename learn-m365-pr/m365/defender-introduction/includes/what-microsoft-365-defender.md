Viewing a threat within the boundaries of a single security product might lead to missed attack information. And if you use multiple products, you'll need to traverse the different products, tools, and reports, which will slow down your ability to respond to an attack. You might not discover the full scope of an attack until it's too late. Microsoft 365 Defender is a unified enterprise defense solution that automatically aggregates and analyzes signal data from multiple sources, for example, anomalous behavior from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or a suspicious login from Microsoft Defender for Identity. It then correlates the data into an incident that represents an attack and provides easy investigation and response across endpoints, identities, email, and applications.

To fully understand the capabilities of Microsoft 365 Defender for your organization, you'll need to check your organization's current licenses or subscriptions. See [this article](/microsoft-365/security/defender/prerequisites) for more information. To maximize the scope of signal data available to Microsoft 365 Defender, you'll need to deploy the other Defender security products.

## Microsoft 365 Defender features

Microsoft 365 Defender helps your organization to better identify, assess, and remediate attacks not only against your security perimeter but also your organization's assets, data, apps, and users.

Some of the key features are:

- **Unified Cross-product view** - Central view of all information for detections, impacted assets, automated actions taken, and related evidence in a single queue and a single portal.
- **Combined incidents queue** - A central list of incidents helps your security team focus on critical items by ensuring the full attack scope, impacted assets, and automated remediation actions are grouped together and surfaced promptly.
- **Self-healing for compromised devices, user identities, and mailboxes** - Automatic remediation capabilities of the full Defender product suite ensures that impacted assets related to an incident are automatically remediated where possible.
- **Cross-product threat hunting** - Security teams can use their unique organizational knowledge to hunt for signs of compromise by creating custom queries against the raw data collected by the Defender security products.
- **Threat Analytics** – Microsoft security research articles describe the latest cyber security threats and how these campaigns might affect your organization.

## The Microsoft 365 Defender portal

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal lets you monitor and manage security across your on-premises identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. Here you can easily view your organization's security health, act to configure devices, users, and apps, and get alerts for suspicious activity. The home page shows a customizable set of cards that provide summary information for a quick assessment of ongoing security threats. The set of cards displayed depends on roles assigned to the signed-in user account.
