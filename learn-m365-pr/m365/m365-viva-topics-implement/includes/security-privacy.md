Viva Topics is based on the security and compliance of content enforced across Microsoft 365. For example, access, retention labels, data sovereignty, and information barriers such as applying sensitivity labels* are all maintained consistently before and after the activation of Viva Topics.

You can also apply restrictions on the scope and availability of topic information shared by Microsoft Viva Topics. To establish Topics security and privacy settings that control topic visibility, you'll need to learn the following:

- Best practices for Topics security & privacy
- Become familiar with what different users can see in topics
- Apply sensitivity labels to protect sensitive data

## Best practices for Topics security & privacy

Setting up Topics does not modify any existing access controls on content in your organization. Users will only see what they already have access to.

The content inventory and user access across current content need to be correctly controlled and secured. If the content on SharePoint and permissions are set to a broader group of people, classified information could be accidentally shared when it should be confidential.

Viva Topics uses existing content security features in Microsoft 365, along with admin controls to control what AI-generated content is shown to users. It is the combination of Microsoft 365 security settings (permissions to sites, files, and folders) and Topics admin settings that determine what any user can see.

## Become familiar with what different users can see in topics

The following table describes what topic viewers, contributors, and Knowledge managers can see in each topic based on their permissions.

|Topic item|What users can see|
|----------|------------------|
|Topic name|Users can see the topic name of all topics in the topic center. Some topics may not be visible if they have a low relevancy to the user. |
|Topic description|AI-generated descriptions are visible only to users who have permissions to the source content. Manually entered or edited descriptions are visible to all users.|
|People|Pinned people are visible to all users. Suggested people are only visible to users who have permissions to the source content.|
|Files|Files are only visible to users who have permissions to the source content.|
|Pages|Pages are only visible to users who have permissions to the source content.|
|Sites|Sites are only visible to users who have permissions to the source content.|

### Apply sensitivity labels to protect sensitive data

When you create a sensitivity label, you can automatically assign it to files and emails to match conditions you specify. This ability to apply sensitivity labels to content automatically is important because:

- You don't need to train your users when to use each of your classifications.
- You don't need to rely on users to classify all content correctly.
- Users no longer need to know about your policies—they can instead focus on their work.

When content has been manually labeled, that label will never be replaced by automatic labeling. However, automatic labeling can replace a lower priority label that was automatically applied.

In addition to using sensitivity labels to classify and protect documents and emails, also use sensitivity labels to protect content across Microsoft Teams sites, Microsoft 365 groups, and SharePoint sites.  

For this container-level classification and protection, use the following label settings:

- Privacy (public or private) of Teams sites and Microsoft 365 groups
- External user access
- External sharing from SharePoint sites
- Access from unmanaged devices
