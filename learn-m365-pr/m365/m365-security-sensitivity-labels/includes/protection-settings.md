Once you label the data, data protection can proceed in several ways and scenarios. Although some people only think of data protection as encryption, it can be a lot more. For example, protection can control the rights of who can access the data and what they can do with it. You might also require different types of authentications based on how the data is protected. Additionally, you can configure usage rights and restrictions, such as the following.

- Only users within your organization can open the company-confidential document or email.
- Only users in the marketing department can edit and print the promotion announcement document or email, while all other users in your organization can only read this document or email.
- Users cannot forward an email or copy information from a document that contains news about an internal reorganization.
- After a specified date, users cannot open a current price list that is sent to business partners.

The most common options for configuring usage rights include the following.

- Viewer (View, Reply, Reply All)
- Reviewer (View, Edit, Reply, Reply All, Forward)
- Co-Author (View, Edit, Copy, Print, Reply, Reply All, Forward)
- Co-Owner (All Rights)
- Custom (Rights that can be assigned individually):

  - View Content

As you define your labels, ask your end users what types of protection they would like. This expedites determining your protection settings.
