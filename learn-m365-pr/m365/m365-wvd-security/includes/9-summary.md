Contoso wanted to deploy a solution that would support its employees who work remotely. This solution needed to be up to date, secure, and highly scalable. You found that Azure Virtual Desktop provided its users with access to every system that a physical desktop would.

This module addressed how to add strict identity and device verification regardless of the location of a user who's accessing company resources. This is the basis of the Zero Trust security model.

In this module, you learned how to protect corporate data and resources. You also learned how an organization can build a modern workplace by using technologies that empower employees to be productive anytime, anywhere. These technologies include Azure Virtual Desktop.

In this module, you reviewed features that create an extra layer of security that doesn't rely only on the device itself. The main points were:

- Security aspects of Azure Virtual Desktop architecture, including a shared responsibility model
- Using Azure Active Directory identity management services
- Securing session hosts and applications
- Storage security
- Network security
- Threat protection and analytics

Azure Virtual Desktop offers significant benefits to businesses. One of the key benefits is the flexibility to scale up or down by using the scaling tool built with Azure Automation and Azure Logic Apps. This tool automatically scales session host VMs in your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. Azure Virtual Desktop also helps to increase security, create an infrastructure, and reduce labor costs.
