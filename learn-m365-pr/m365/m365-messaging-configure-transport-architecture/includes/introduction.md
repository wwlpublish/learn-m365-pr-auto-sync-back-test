Exchange Online is automatically configured to send and receive email from the internet. However, if you have Exchange servers on-premises or strict security requirements, you may need to implement a transport architecture by using connectors. 

Suppose you work for an online retailer. You have a new Exchange Online implementation in Microsoft 365 but some mailboxes remain on your on-premises Exchange servers. You also work closely with two wholesale partners and want to ensure that all emails exchanged with them are secure. You will want to investigate Exchange Online connectors to set up a suitable transport architecture. 

When you finish this module, you should be able to:  

- Explain what connectors are and how they route email. 
- Describe how to create and configure connectors. 
- Describe how to use connectors to secure email transfer to partner organizations.
