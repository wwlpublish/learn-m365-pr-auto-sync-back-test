## Securing administrative access to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Defender for Identities

Security administrators often focus on best practices for securing their organization's users, apps, services, and devices. But it's easy to forget that Security Administrators are also users. And it's at least, if not more, important to secure these administrative accounts within your organization.

This blog seeks to highlight this issue, and to identify best practices to help ensure your administrative accounts are properly secured. In the article, the author discusses multifactor authentication and default Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles.

## Limiting inherited roles from Azure Active Directory in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

In this article, the authors discuss how to restrict accesses in line with your organization's security best practices and observe the principle of least privilege. Access to Defender for Cloud Apps is granted through inherited roles from Azure AD or through Azure role-based access control (RBAC) assignments from within the Defender for Cloud Apps portal itself.

The article seeks to answer the question:

> _We have a defined Azure RBAC policy. We have assigned Security administrators to specific groups. These groups have access across our entire security stack. But we want to follow least privilege and grant access only to specific products with the permissions inherited from the Security administrator role. Given that not all the products have a product-specific administrator role available in Azure AD, how can we limit the Security administrator role's access in Defender for Cloud Apps without impacting existing permissions to other products?_
