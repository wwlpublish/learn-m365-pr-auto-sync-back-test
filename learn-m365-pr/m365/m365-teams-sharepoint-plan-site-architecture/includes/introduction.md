SharePoint provides three main types of sites to help you create your intranet so that it aligns with the needs of your business, your employees, and your readiness. They share a common structure, with the fundamental differences being intent, usage expectations, governance and how they are created.

- **Collaborate: Team sites.** A SharePoint team site connects you and your team to the content, information, and apps you rely on every day. You can use a team site to store and collaborate on files or to create and manage lists of information.
- **Communicate: Communication sites.** Communication sites are meant to communicate broadly to a large audience. 
- **Connect: Hub sites.** Hub sites provide a connection point and central portal for a group of related team or communication sites. Every SharePoint site can be associated to a hub site, which is a flat structure of sites that share navigation, branding, and other elements. This type of structure is flexible and adaptive to the changing needs of your organization.
