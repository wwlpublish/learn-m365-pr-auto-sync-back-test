Privileged access management allows granular access control over privileged admin tasks in Microsoft 365. Privileged access management requires users to request just-in-time access to complete elevated and privileged tasks through a highly scoped and time-bound approval workflow. This configuration gives users just-enough-access to perform the task at hand without risking exposure of sensitive data or critical configuration settings.

Now that you have completed this module, you should be able to:

- Explain the difference between privileged access management and privileged identity management.
- Describe the privileged access management process flow.
- Describe how to configure and enable privileged access management.
