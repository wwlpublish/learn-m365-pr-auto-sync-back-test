Employee adoption for new technology is a key driver of implementation and total cost of Viva Topics ownership, including Viva Topics training for all new users.

Consider brainstorming sessions to reward champions and help unmotivated users get onboard. Different roles might be more involved in different phases of the project. Tenant administrators are involved in setting up Viva Topics. SMEs and champions don't get involved until you start defining topics to help solve these challenges:

- Increase awareness and affinity, skills development, growth, and reward  
- Provide proactive awareness efforts
- Personalize learning when and where users need it
- Offer diverse learning modalities
- Update content with Viva Topics technology
