You've learned four Viva Topics roles: Topic viewers, Topic contributors, Knowledge managers, and Knowledge admins. Users have access to only those topics to which they've been granted access.

You have reviewed the different scenarios in your organization to learn how Viva Topics will impact roles in your organization. Different roles will experience different views, access, interaction, and scenarios with topics.

Viva Topics can automate scenarios to improve productivity and reduce costs, such as onboarding, training, expertise finding, and decision-making. Employee adoption for new technology is a key driver of implementation and total cost of Viva Topics ownership, including Viva Topics training for all new users.
