- **Modernization scanner** – Use the SharePoint modernization scanner to prepare your classic SharePoint sites for modernization for Viva Topics.
- **Transform to Modern** – Classic SharePoint sites with classic pages: wiki pages, web part pages, blog pages or publishing pages will need to transform to a modern user interface with Modern SharePoint.
- **Retention** – When content has retention settings assigned to it, this content remains in its original location. People can continue to work with their documents or email as if nothing's changed. But if they edit or delete content included in the retention policy, a copy of the content is automatically retained.
- **Sensitivity labels** – Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) solution to let you classify and protect your data, while ensuring user productivity and collaboration.
- **Data Loss Prevention** – With a data loss prevention (DLP) policy in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across Office 365.
