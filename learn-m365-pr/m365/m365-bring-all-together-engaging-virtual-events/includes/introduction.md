A successful virtual event involves work from many people: 
- The organizer who sets up the meeting and lines up presenters
- The producer who manages content, presenters, and tooling 
- The moderator who runs the event itself and coordinates questions from attendees. 
- The attendees themselves - your audience. 

Each of these roles experiences the event differently. If you're putting together a virtual event, one of the last tasks on your plate is preparing your producers, presenters, moderators, and attendees to help make their experiences as great as possible. 
 
As a member of the event team putting together a virtual summit for your organization, you've planned and created an engaging, inclusive, and accessible virtual event. Now the day has arrived, and the only things left to consider are the presenter, moderator, and attendees' experiences.

This module walks you through the day-of experiences for the producer, presenter, moderator, and attendee and includes best practices to make sure everyone gets the most out of your virtual event. You can share this training with others on your event team to help them prepare.

This module has content for producers, presenters, moderators, and attendees.
