Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps you by providing a single, modern, integrated management platform for managing, protecting, and monitoring all of your organization's endpoints. These endpoints may also include the on-premises computers and devices used by your organization. 

The first part of attaching your on-premises devices to the cloud is call tenant attach. Tenant attach allows you to recognize your Configuration Manager devices and infrastructure in the Microsoft Intune cloud service and take actions from Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

In this module, you've learned how to attach your on-premises Configuration Manager devices to your cloud-based tenant using tenant attach. The goals of this module included the following:

- Understand tenant attach
- Confirm tenant attach prerequisites
- Enable internet endpoints
- Enable device upload
- Display the connector status
- Perform device actions
- View on-premises device details

## Next steps

Now that you have completed attaching to your tenant, consider adding co-management. For more information, see the following resources:
