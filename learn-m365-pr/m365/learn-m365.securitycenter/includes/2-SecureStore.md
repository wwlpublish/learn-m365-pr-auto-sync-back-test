With Microsoft Secure Score in the Microsoft 365 security center, you can have increased visibility and control over your organization’s security posture. From a centralized dashboard you can monitor and improve the security for your Microsoft 365 identities, data, apps, devices, and infrastructure. The alerts include recommendations from Azure AD, Intune, Cloud App Security, Azure Security Center and Microsoft Defender ATP. 

The overview page is the place to get an all-up view of the total score. This can be subdivided into the historical trend of your secure score with benchmark comparisons and prioritized recommended actions that can be taken to improve your score.

You can increase your score by configuring recommended security features, performing security-related tasks (such as viewing reports), or addressing the improvement action with a third-party application or software. Some actions are scored for partial completion, like enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your users. 

As you dive deeper into the secure score, you’ll find a list of recommended improvement actions ranked by Microsoft according to their security value. You can adjust these parameters to ensure that you only make the changes to your security environment that works for your organization.
