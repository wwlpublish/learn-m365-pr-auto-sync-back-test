Reporting in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal is split up into four categories:

- **Identities** – user accounts and credentials
- **Data** – email and document contents
- **Devices** – computers, mobile phones, and other devices
- **Apps** – programs and attached online services

In the **Identities** category of Reports, you can track:

- Users with the most detected anomalies
- How many users are reported at risk by Conditional Access policies
- The number of global admins in your org

The **Data** category helps track user activity that could lead to unauthorized data disclosure. You can see:

- Users who share the most files from cloud apps
- How many Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy matches occurred
- How many DLP policies overrides or false positives are reported
- How many DLP policy matches happened in 3rd-party cloud services via Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

The **Device** category ensures devices are secure, up-to-date, and that you can spot potential threats. You can see:

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts, which may require an immediate response
- Intune enrolled device data such as: device compliance, devices with active malware, and types of malware on devices
- Attack Surface Reduction rules, which help prevent actions that are used by exploit-seeking malware

The **App** category provides more insight into how cloud apps are being used in your organization, including what kinds of apps, their level of risk, and alerts.

This includes:

- Monitor email accounts at risk
- Apps discovered by **Defender for Cloud Apps** that have been granted permissions by users
- Cloud Discovery reporting to show what kind of apps are being used
- Cloud app activity locations
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** alerts signaling infrastructure health
