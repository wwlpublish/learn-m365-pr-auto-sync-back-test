When you move from an on-premises to a cloud-based organization, you increase flexibility, both for employees and the IT team. However, this move also introduces new challenges for keeping your organization secure. To get the full benefit of cloud apps and services, you have to balance supporting access with protecting critical data. Microsoft Cloud App Security helps you achieve that balance. It provides rich visibility, control over data travel, and sophisticated analytics to identify and combat cyberthreats across all your cloud services.
