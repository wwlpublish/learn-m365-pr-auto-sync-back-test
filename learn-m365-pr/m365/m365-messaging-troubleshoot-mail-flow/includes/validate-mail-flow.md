There are several steps that you should perform to validate inbound and outbound mail flow.

## Check an alternative mail client

Your first step is to check if the mail client itself is causing the mail flow issues. If you're having issues with the Outlook desktop application, try Outlook on the web, or vice versa. Similarly, if you normally use the Outlook app in iOS or Android, try connecting with the Outlook desktop application or Outlook on the web.

If you can isolate the problem to a single access method, the problem is with the application, or the configuration of the application, and not with mail flow.

## Run Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

If mail flow problems are limited to a single user, download and run the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant on the affected device. The Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant checks for most issues common to client configuration, including licensing, profiles, or running the wrong version of Outlook. For Outlook for Mac, download and run Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant from a PC.

## Check service health for Exchange Online issues

If you've tried a different mail client, and if running the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant didn't resolve the mail flow issue, check the service health for Exchange Online.

Sign into Microsoft 365 Apps for Business as an administrator, and then start the Admin app. Under **Service health**, go to **View the service health**. You'll see any previously reported issues for your organization, and, if available, the steps you need to take to resolve them.
