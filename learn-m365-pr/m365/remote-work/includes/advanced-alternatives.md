If you don't have Microsoft 365, Windows 10 can still help you connect to your workplace computer and even your organization's network more securely.

## Remotely connect to your work PC

You can use Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) to sign into work PCs and resources from another location. RDC is a Microsoft technology that allows one computer (say, your work laptop that you've brought home) to connect over a network or the internet to a PC at your workplace. This is especially useful if you use a desktop PC at work and a laptop at home.

Once you're remotely connected to your workplace computer, you can control it as if you were sitting in front of it - open any of the apps and edit any files on it, and connect to any network resources available to that computer.  

Before you can remotely connect to your workplace computer, you must be at that computer to set it up to accept a Remote Desktop Connection.

## Connect to your organization's network

A virtual private network (VPN) can give you a more secure way to connect to your organization's network and the internet. This is especially useful if, say, you're using public wi-fi.
