The shift to computing in the cloud has impacted the way organizations design their networks. And as more organizations shift workloads to the cloud, your internal network should be reviewed to make sure that new networking principles are used to maximize the end-user experience.

- You learned about the global Microsoft 365 network and how it's been optimized for audio and video used in Microsoft Teams.
- You learned that local Internet breakouts and local DNS resolution are key to optimizing corporate network connectivity to Microsoft 365.
- You learned about peering points, network locations where two or more networks meet.
- You learned about transport relays, and how they translate between various protocols so that everybody can speak to each other.
- You also learned about meeting hosting, that media will travel to the Microsoft datacenter closest to the first person who joined the meeting.

You're encouraged to review the *Learn more* links at the end of each unit to get a deeper understanding of Microsoft 365 and Teams connectivity principles.

Now that you've finished this module, you should be able to:
  
- Understand how Microsoft built Microsoft 365 to limit reliance on the public internet.
- Design your organization's network to best leverage Microsoft 365's design.
- Understand how Microsoft Teams meetings are  hosted in the closest geographical region to attendees.
