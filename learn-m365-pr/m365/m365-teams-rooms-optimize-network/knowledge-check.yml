    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Which of the following will most help improve Microsoft 365 (and Teams) performance?"
      choices:
      - content: "Use an Azure Front Door."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure Front Doors are found across the world and help provide a good connection to Microsoft 365. However, if you are not using local internet egress or have incorrectly configured DNS, you could end up going to a remote Azure Front Door and have poor performance."
      - content: "Use centralized network egress."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "In some cases, a centralized network egress is a good design – usually for organizations that are close to each other geographically. But for organizations spread across a country, a continent, or the whole planet, centralized network egress should be avoided."
      - content: "Connect to the Microsoft network as quickly as possible."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That’s right. The faster you can get on the Microsoft network, the faster you can access the best Azure Front Door. That will provide the best possible client experience."

    - content: "Where will a Microsoft Teams meeting be hosted?"
      choices:
      - content: "In the region of the first person to join the meeting."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The first person to join a meeting dictates where the meeting is hosted."
      - content: "In the region of the person who scheduled the meeting."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The first person to join a meeting, and not the meeting organizer, dictates where the meeting is hosted."
      - content: "In the region where the tenant is located."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The first person to join the meeting dictates where the meeting is homed – even if tha's' in a region outside of the tenant’s configured home region."
      
    - content: "Which protocol is optimal when using Teams media?"
      choices:
      - content: "TCP"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "TCP is a slower – but more reliable - protocol than UDP. As such, UDP is the preferred protocol for Teams media."
      - content: "UDP"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You got it! Due to the speed of UDP, it’s the preferred protocol for Teams media."
      - content: "HTTP"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While HTTP is a supported protocol, it is the poorest performing protocol for Teams media."
