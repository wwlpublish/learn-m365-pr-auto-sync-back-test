As a member of the security team of your organization, you understand that you must have a healthy approach to security. This means that you want to be able to carry out the identification, assessment, and remediation of endpoint vulnerabilities and threats.

Here, you'll learn about vulnerability management in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

## What is threat and vulnerability management?

Threat and vulnerability management is a component of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. It provides built-in tools and features that allow you to manage threats and vulnerabilities across your environments, because you're able to:

- **Discover misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real-time**
  - Devices onboarded to Defender for Endpoint automatically provide information about vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. You can see security issues from the dashboard along with recommendations for remediation. You can take advantage of exposure score, which indicates device exposure to threats and vulnerabilities across your organization. In addition, Microsoft Secure Score for devices aggregates a score that indicates the general security configuration state of the devices across your organization.
  - Information about software across the organization, installations, patches, and uninstallation is readily available. You'll receive reports of newly discovered vulnerabilities across apps, along with details about how to remediate them.

- **Intelligently prioritize vulnerabilities**
  - You can use risk-based prioritization. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on threat insights, likelihood of breach, and asset value. This enables you to assess the true threats to your organization so that you can more quickly decide on the best way to prioritize next steps. You can protect high-value assets by identifying and prioritizing devices with confidential data, business-critical apps, and devices used by high-value users.

- **Accelerate and simplify remediation**
  - Security teams can request IT admins to remediate vulnerabilities directly from the  security recommendation pages in Microsoft Endpoint Manager. You can explore different kinds of mitigations, such as configuration changes to minimize the risks of vulnerabilities from software vulnerabilities.

You access threat and vulnerability management from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal:
