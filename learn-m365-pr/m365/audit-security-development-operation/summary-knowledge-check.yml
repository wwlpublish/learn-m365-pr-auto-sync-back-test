    questions:
    - content: "What is the correct order for the five core development phases of Microsoft’s SDL?"
      choices:
      - content: "Design > Requirements > Implementation > Verification > Release"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft’s SDL defines security and privacy requirements before the software design phase."
      - content: "Requirements > Design > Implementation > Release > Verification"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft’s SDL requires that all new builds are verified and approved before release."
      - content: "Implementation > Requirements > Design > Verification > Release"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft’s SDL requires defined security requirements and software design before implementation of the design."
      - content: "Requirements > Design > Implementation > Verification > Release"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. These are the phases of Microsoft’s Security Development Lifecycle."
      
    - content: "How does the Microsoft SDL use threat modeling to improve security?"
      choices:
      - content: "To verify code meets design specifications before it is checked in"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft requires manual code review to verify code meets design specifications."
      - content: "To identify vulnerabilities in the design of a product or service"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Microsoft requires threat modeling to identify vulnerabilities in the design of products and services."
      - content: "To release code securely across the environment"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft requires that all new builds undergo testing, security review, and approval to release code securely across the environment."
      - content: "To detect and respond to potential security incidents"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft detects security incidents through security monitoring and responds using the incident response process."
      
    - content: "What category of automated tools does Microsoft use to test and validate whether source code contains vulnerabilities?"
      choices:
      - content: "Static code analysis tools"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Static code analysis tools check source code for vulnerabilities."
      - content: "Binary analysis tools"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Binary analysis tools check builds at the binary level for security flaws."
      - content: "Ring deployment"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Ring deployment is used to securely test and deploy code changes."
      - content: "Component Governance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Component Governance is used to detect and track open-source components."

    - content: "Which of the following does Microsoft use to test the detection and response capabilities of its services?"
      choices:
      - content: "Attack simulation"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The Red Team performs attack simulations to test the detection and response capabilities of Microsoft 365 services."
      - content: "Component Governance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Component Governance is used to detect and track open-source components."
      - content: "Security awareness training"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Security awareness training prepares employees to recognize and report security incidents, but it does not test detection or response capabilities."
      - content: "Threat modeling"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Threat modeling is used to identify vulnerabilities in the design of products and services."
