Secure development at Microsoft begins with the people who build our products and services. All Microsoft employees are provided with security awareness training appropriate to their role. Initial training occurs when a new employee begins working at Microsoft, and annual refresher training takes place every year thereafter. This training is designed to provide employees with an understanding of Microsoft's fundamental approach to security.

In addition to security awareness training, developers and engineers receive appropriate training to stay informed about security basics and recent trends in security and privacy. Attending these trainings helps ensure software is created with security and privacy in mind and helps development teams stay current on security issues.

Developers and engineers are encouraged to seek additional security and privacy education appropriate to their needs or products. All members of software development teams, including full-time employees, interns, contingent staff, subcontractors, and third parties, have access to advanced security and privacy training.
