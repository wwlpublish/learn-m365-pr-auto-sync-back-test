In the introductory scenario, as a data analyst for HR business intelligence, you were interested in finding advanced analysis techniques and new ways to visualize Workplace Analytics data. You saw an opportunity to use the `wpa` R package to create more flexible analysis and incorporate new techniques into your current process.

It would otherwise be time-consuming and cumbersome to create this analysis from scratch. To build a tool to validate and explore the data on your own, you could create custom Power BI reports by using advanced DAX code, or write your own code to create the analysis in R, but this work would require much time and advanced programming expertise.

The `wpa` R package provides a way to easily incorporate more advanced collaboration analysis into a data science workflow. You now understand how including the `wpa` R package in your Workplace Analytics workflow enables greater flexibility for advanced analysis. And you can see how it empowers you to share deeper insights about the employee working patterns with leaders in your organization.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:

- Explain what the `wpa` R package is, and how to use it to analyze Workplace Analytics data.
- Install R and set up the `wpa` R package.
- Use the `wpa` R package to validate and explore Workplace Analytics data.
- Run quick start reports and use the functions in the `wpa` R package to create your own analysis.

The `wpa` R package is continuously evolving and integrating more new features. Check the package website often to ensure you have the latest features. As an open-source project, `wpa` also welcomes and relies on contributions from users. If you have:

- A feature you would like to request.
- A bug you would like to report.
- Documentation that you would like to improve.

…you are welcome to submit an issue on GitHub. Experienced R users are welcome to create pull requests directly to GitHub. See the links in the Learn more section to find new features, submit issues, or create new pull requests.
