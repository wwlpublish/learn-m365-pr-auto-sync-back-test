To successfully set up SharePoint Syntex, you must have Global admin or SharePoint admin permissions. These permissions are required to access the Microsoft 365 admin center. Set up for SharePoint Syntex starts in the Microsoft 365 admin center. You can alter settings _after_ your initial setup of SharePoint Syntex, if necessary. Those changes can be made in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

During setup of SharePoint Syntex, you'll be asked to name your default content center. It helps to have that name already in mind. Will it be a company-wide content center? Or does it make more strategic sense for your company to create several content centers that align with lines of business? Your naming convention decisions may depend on those choices.

Your organization, Contoso Electronics, has decided on a staged rollout for SharePoint Syntex. Your project team selected the Human Resources department's content library as the first target. Their primary goal is to define and apply Contoso's data retention and privacy policies in a controlled rollout that will bring the Human Resources documents and forms into compliance in an organized and easy-to-understand fashion. To maintain confidentiality, the Human Resources department and your project team decided to create a content center that will house the document understanding models dedicated to Human Resources. The models will be applied to libraries in Human Resources' main content site. The name of the content center will be _"Contoso Electronics Human Resources content center"_. You'll partner with the Human Resources management team to set up SharePoint Syntex on Human Resources' SharePoint library.

> A limited preview content center is available for evaluation through the SharePoint admin center site creation menu.

## Licensing and credits

The first step is to assess licensing requirements. Your organization must have a subscription to SharePoint Syntex _and_ each user needs a SharePoint Syntex license. Read more about [licensing requirements](/microsoft-365/contentunderstanding/set-up-content-understanding#requirements). If, at any time, your organization cancels their SharePoint Syntex subscription, _no content will be deleted from existing libraries_. However, _access to creating or running document understanding or form processing models will be lost_.  

In the second step, you must purchase AI Builder credits. Because of the slower, staged rollout, Contoso Electronics will require that you and the Human Resources management team estimate how many documents you'll process each month using the [AI Builder calculator](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder-calculator/). You can also use the AI Builder calculator to purchase the credits you need to begin processing documents and forms.

> [!NOTE]
> If you deploy 300 or more SharePoint Syntex licenses, 1 million AI Builder credits will be included in your subscription.
