Microsoft Cloud App Security includes several advanced features that you can use to complete your security protection in a heterogeneous environment.

You're an administrator for Contoso, a large multi-national organization, which is using Microsoft Cloud App Security to identify and mitigate security risks in its on-premises and cloud infrastructure. Although the security tools have proved effective, you're aware that some potential weaknesses remain. For example, you want to ensure that iOS devices can be protected and you want to be able to respond quickly to new threats.

In this module, you'll learn about advanced features, such as custom indicators of compromise, integration with Microsoft 365 Defender portal, and programmatic access to Cloud App Security through the Microsoft Cloud App Security REST API.
