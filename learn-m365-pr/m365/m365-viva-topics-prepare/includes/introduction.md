Viva Topics is an add-on service of Microsoft Viva, an employee experience platform (EXP) for a unified knowledge and content experience across Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Search. There are two rollout strategies to choose from:

- **Fully crowd-sourced model** where everyone in the organization can add and edit topics.
- **Authoritative model** where a set group of people is responsible for adding and editing topics. They can rely on other people, but they are the ones responsible for doing it. In this model, everyone else is just a consumer where they can view Viva Topics in the term store.  

To include the appropriate content for your users, you need the right people for crowdsourcing and resources.  

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Create a deployment plan for Viva Topics.
- Get your environment ready for Viva Topics.
- Implement best practices for deploying Viva Topics.
