In this module, you'll learn about Microsoft 365 capabilities that can help you monitor and gain insight into your sensitive data landscape.

The Microsoft 365 compliance center helps you understand label use across your organization. It helps you gain insight into:

- The overall activity of sensitivity labeling during the past 30 days.
- The distribution of labels used, such as how many "Highly Confidential" labels were applied.
- Where labels were used, such as within Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or File Explorer.

Because sensitive data can also live on mobile devices, endpoints represent a key control point for your information protection strategy – especially since devices are often the entry point for sophisticated attacks and data breaches. This module describes how Azure Information Protection analytics help give admins better visibility into sensitive information residing on managed devices.
