In your firm of legal advisors, the sensitive nature of your business requires that you deal with clients' secret information every day. You had noticed regular attacks and you wanted to use industry-leading techniques to counter them. By using Safe Attachments, you can intercept files with insecure content, as they're exchanged in Teams. You also used multifactor authentication (MFA) to ensure that users' credentials didn't constitute a weak link in the security chain. And application protection policies protect your company data at the app level.

Microsoft Teams promotes close collaboration and high productivity for your users. By implementing Safe Attachments, MFA, and app protection policies you can ensure this extra functionality doesn't introduce extra opportunities for malicious users to attack your users and data.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe how Safe Links protects your users.
- Demonstrate how Safe Attachments can prevent data compromise.
- Explain how to configure multifactor authentication to secure access to Teams.
