Microsoft 365 Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint provide a wide variety of collaboration features, including coauthoring and @ mentions. They are also integrated with sensitivity labels and data loss prevention.

With Office and SharePoint, multiple people can work together on a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presentation. When everyone is working at the same time, that's called coauthoring. Office provides coauthoring functionality for Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Visio. Co-authoring works in both the desktop app and web versions.

Coauthoring is easy to use from the end user's point of view. When a user wants to work on a document in Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, or Visio apps or on the web, they merely open it from SharePoint and start working. If another user already has the document open, both users can edit the document at the same time.

When users are editing a file in Office, they might see a notification that others are working in the file too. Users edit as they normally would, and if others are also editing the document, Office alerts them to their presence, and shows them where in the file they are working.

When users comment on a document, presentation, or spreadsheet and use the **@** sign with someone's name, the person mentioned receives mail with a link to the comment. Clicking the link brings them into the document and into the conversation.
