In a collaborative environment, users often need to share documents and data with people outside your company, such as customers and partners. Suppose you want to ensure that, when required, your users can share information externally, to promote close collaboration with partners and communication with clients.

Here, you'll learn how SharePoint's external sharing features work.

## What is external sharing?

The external sharing features of SharePoint let users in your organization share content with people outside the organization, such as partners, vendors, clients, or customers. You can also use external sharing to share between licensed users on multiple Microsoft 365 subscriptions if your organization has more than one subscription. Planning for external sharing should be included as part of your overall permissions planning for SharePoint.

External sharing is turned on by default for your entire SharePoint environment and the team sites in it. You may want to turn it off globally before people start using sites or until you know exactly how you want to use the feature.

## How the external sharing settings work

SharePoint has external sharing settings at both the organization and the site level (previously called the *site collection* level). To allow external sharing on any site, you must allow it at the organization level. You can then restrict external sharing for other sites. Whichever option you choose at the organization or site level, the more restrictive functionality is still available. For example, if you choose to allow anonymous sharing, users can still share with guests who sign in, and with internal users.

## Security and privacy

If you have confidential information that should never be shared externally, we recommend storing the information in a site that has external sharing turned off. Create additional sites as needed to use for external sharing. This helps you to manage security risk by preventing external access to sensitive information.

## Guest management

Guests typically will be added to your directory, and permissions and groups work the same for guests as they do for internal users.

Because guests do not have a license in your organization, they are limited to basic collaboration tasks:

- They can use Office.com for viewing and editing documents.
- They can perform tasks on a site based on the permission level that they've been given.
- They will be able to see other types of content on sites, depending on the permissions they've been given.

If your authenticated guests need greater capability such as OneDrive storage or creating a Microsoft Flow, you must assign them an appropriate license.
