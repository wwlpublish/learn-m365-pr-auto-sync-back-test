Teams combines multiple Microsoft 365 services and is therefore dependent on the correct implementation and operation of these services. These services include—but aren't limited to—SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and OneDrive for Business.

Although not all services are required, we highly recommend that you implement all of them. If you choose not to implement certain services, it will affect the functionality that Teams can offer your organization. For example, though you don't have to implement SharePoint Online, Teams does rely on SharePoint Online for certain functionality such as file sharing in group conversations, so not implementing this service will reduce the functionality offered through the client.
