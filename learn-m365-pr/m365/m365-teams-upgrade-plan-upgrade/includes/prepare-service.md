By preparing your organization for collaboration and cloud voice services with Teams, you can be sure you're ready to provide these capabilities to your organization.

The following checklists walk you through the steps for deploying Microsoft Teams in your organization:

- [Prepare Microsoft 365 for Teams](/microsoftteams/office-365-groups)
- [Configure Teams core capabilities](/MicrosoftTeams/deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page)
- [Configure networking](/microsoftteams/upgrade-prepare-environment-prepare-network)
- [Configure cloud voice workloads in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/cloud-voice-landing-page)
- [Configure Direct Routing in Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/direct-routing-landing-page)

 The tasks and activities in these checklists are the core "to-do" items that apply to every deployment of collaboration and voice capabilities with Teams. You can customize the checklists to include the activities and tasks that are specific to your own Teams journey.

Use the provided checklists to track the status of each individual activity and task, and to be sure you haven't skipped any critical steps. Each activity includes a detailed description of required actions and references to additional information that you can use to complete that activity.

Although we recommend that you follow the checklists in order, the exact sequence will depend on the scope of your deployment and the configuration and complexity of your environment. They're organized to support either a "green field" Teams deployment (one with no previous Skype for Business Online presence) or upgrading from Skype for Business Online to Teams.

When you're onboarding users on a per-site basis, we highly recommended that you use the Site Enablement Playbook for Voice (Playbook) as a supplementary guide to these checklists.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the configuration settings are common between Teams and Skype for Business Online. You use the Microsoft Teams admin center to configure those settings.
