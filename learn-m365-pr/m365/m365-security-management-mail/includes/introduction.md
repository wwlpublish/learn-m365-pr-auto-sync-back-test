  - Good: Recipient intentionally signed up to receive emails for newsletters or promotions. Reputable ones provide the option to unsubscribe.
  - Bad: Recipient didn't sign up to receive emails. Sometimes they provide the option to unsubscribe.
- **Phishing**

  - Spear phishing: a targeted attempt at a specific user (typically a high-profile user or admin) or organization
