Data classification and protection are some of today's biggest challenges to information security. The first step of your information protection journey is knowing how your organization uses data.

Not all data is created equal. Some data is more sensitive and requires a stronger level of protection and control than other types. The kinds of information that need protecting depends on your internal security requirements and compliance obligations. Because every organization may have different governance or compliance standards, it's important to allow customization of classification policies.

For instance, a beverage company needs to protect the secret recipe to its most famous soft drink. However, a finance company's cafeteria recipes are not so critical to everyday business. There are general guidelines for more obvious sensitive data, such as credit card and social security numbers, but no two organizations classify data the same way.
