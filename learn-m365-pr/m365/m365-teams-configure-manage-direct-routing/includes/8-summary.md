In your clothing retail company, you had completed your planning and wanted to configure Microsoft Teams Direct Routing and use it to replace the hardware-based private branch exchange (PBX) system that you were using. You've seen how to use Session Border Controllers (SBCs), voice routing, user provisioning, and media optimization to implement your new PBX in Teams. You've also learned how to manage Direct Routing and monitor its behavior.

Direct Routing enables you to integrate telephony services with other forms of communication in Teams, including audio and video conferencing, chats, and file management.
Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how to configure and connect a Session Border Controller (SBC).
- Describe the process for configuring simple and advanced voice routing.
- Describe how to provision users, implement number translation, create, and assign dial plans.
- Demonstrate how to configure Local Media Optimization.
- Explain how to manage Direct Routing and resolve common SBC configuration issues.
