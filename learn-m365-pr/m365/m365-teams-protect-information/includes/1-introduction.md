Microsoft Teams allows users to share information and communicate effectively, wherever they're located. In Teams, users are likely to share sensitive and business-critical information, which must be defended against unintended data loss and malicious attempts to steal it. This module discusses how to protect the information stored in Teams.

Imagine you're a Microsoft Teams security admin and your company needs to protect users and their data that's in Teams. You've been asked to create a data protection policy, record access in Teams, and allow guests to securely be added to team channels.

Before starting this module, you should understand how to defend against threats in Microsoft Teams. We recommend you first complete the [Defend against threats in Teams](/training/modules/m365-teams-defend-against-threats/) Learn module.
