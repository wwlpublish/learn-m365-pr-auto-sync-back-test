This unit gives a quick overview of the Hybrid Configuration wizard process. First, the wizard creates the Hybrid Configuration object in your on-premises Active Directory. This Active Directory object stores the hybrid configuration information for the hybrid deployment and is updated by the Hybrid Configuration wizard. Next, the wizard gathers existing on-premises Exchange and Active Directory topology configuration data, and Microsoft 365 tenant and Exchange Online configuration data. The wizard defines several organization parameters, and then runs an extensive sequence of configuration tasks in both the on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.

The general phases of the hybrid deployment configuration process are:

- Verifying prerequisites and performing topology checks.
- Testing account credentials.
- Making hybrid deployment configuration changes.

After testing the hybrid management accounts, conducting the verification and topology checks, and gathering configuration information that you defined in the wizard process, the Hybrid Configuration wizard makes the configuration changes to create and enable the hybrid deployment.
