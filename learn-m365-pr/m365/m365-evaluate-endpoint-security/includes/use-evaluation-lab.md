You've learned what the evaluation lab is. But before you can start using it, you'll also need to learn about its key components and capabilities.

Here, you'll learn where to find key information, manage devices, the different types of simulations available, the simulation gallery, and how to access tutorials.

## Review key information at a glance

You use the overview tab to review key information about your evaluation lab at a glance, such as the number of active devices, simulations, information about alerts and incidents, key findings, and more:

## Add and monitor devices

Use the devices tab to review the status of your test devices:

  You can also use it to add devices for your simulations. You do this by selecting **Add devices**. You then use the **Add device** pane to specify the type of device you want to add, along with which tools you want to include on the device when it's provisioned.

  You can choose Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 devices.

## Create and monitor simulations

Attack simulations scenarios are controlled experiments that you can run to test how well protected your endpoints are against specific threats based on varying factors. There are different types of attack simulation scenarios that you can run in the evaluation lab. These are:

- **"Do It Yourself" attack scenarios**
  - Here, you take advantage of easy to use, well documented, and safe scripts to run your own scenarios.
- **Threat simulator scenarios**
  - Alternatively, you can choose to install any of the many supported threat simulators. These will allow you to run built-in simulation scenarios on your devices. They are useful if you want to run industry-leading simulators with target scenarios based on the latest research and threat understanding.

You use the simulation tab in the evaluation lab to monitor the status of your simulations. You can also use it to create new simulations by selecting **Create simulation**:

The Create simulation pane appears, where you specify details such as the simulator you want to use, and the kind of simulation you want, along with which device your simulation should be run against:

### Use the simulation gallery

The simulation gallery is where you'll find all the sophisticated attack simulations provided by Microsoft and industry-leading partners.

To find the simulation gallery, select **Evaluation & tutorials > Tutorials & simulations** in the navigation pane:

You use the simulation gallery to get you a detailed description for each simulation, along with details about the techniques it uses. When you've decided on a simulation, you can run it directly from the gallery. To run a simulation, you select **Run**:

:::image type="content" source="../media/1-run-simulation-gallery-simulation.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to run a simulation from the gallery." lightbox="../media/1-run-simulation-gallery-simulation.png":::

This will open the Create simulation pane, which you can use to create the simulation:

:::image type="content" source="../media/1-create-simulation-gallery.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to create simulation from the simulation gallery." lightbox="../media/1-create-simulation-gallery.png":::

The fields will be pre-populated for you. You just have to choose the device you want to target. When you select **Create simulation**, your simulation is run automatically.

#### Access Tutorials

You can also use the simulation gallery to access detailed tutorials to help you to understand how to run simulations to evaluate the security of your endpoints. Each tutorial comes with a simulation file and a detailed walkthrough on the steps you should take to run the tutorial.

You can find tutorials by selecting the **Tutorials** tab in the Simulations & tutorials page:
