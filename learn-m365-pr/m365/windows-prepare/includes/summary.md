A sizeable percentage of Woodgrove's Windows 10 devices were out of support or nearing the end of support. Previously you presented a plan to help your organization to stay current with the latest Windows 10 feature updates from Microsoft. Now you helped Woodgrove prepare its environment for the Windows 10 feature update.
