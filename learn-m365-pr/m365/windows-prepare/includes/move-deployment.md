Your manager wants to know how the team can determine whether the environment as a whole is ready to progress to the next phase of deployment. As the process manager, you decide that you want to determine this in the most straightforward way possible.

## Determine overall readiness

Woodgrove has made many decisions regarding the different components that make up and support its environment. For example, Woodgrove had to make choices about which devices to use for piloting, how to validate applications, and more. Now it needs to review the overall readiness of the environment based on those decisions to help understand whether it's ready to go to the next phase. You're the process manager, so you decide that you'll work with the other roles that are also part of the process to decide whether all objectives have been met.  You create the following tracking list:

|*Area*  |Objective  |Status  |Accomplished  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|*Applications*|Select applications for regression and pilot testing.|All critical and important applications have been selected for regression and pilot testing.|Yes|
|*Infrastructure*|Agree whether the infrastructure meets the deployment readiness criteria (pass or fail).|Deployment criteria passed.|Yes|
|*Settings*|Create a security and configuration baseline file that can be used for Pilot deployment.|Generated.|Yes|
|*Devices*|Select and configure test devices.|With the help of Desktop Analytics, 50% of devices in the environment have been selected and configured for pilot testing.|Yes|
|*Devices*|Select test users.|IT volunteers and support desk members selected for testing.|Yes|
|*Operations*|- Create a schedule for communications.<br/>- Create draft content for emails.|- Communication schedule created to match deployment schedule.<br/>- Draft emails produced for company-wide distribution.|Yes|

This will help you understand overall readiness. As the process manager, you'll use it to sign out on whether the environment is ready for the next phase.
