  - content: "You want to ensure that users of Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and a custom app that your company uses cannot access a specific custom domain on the internet. Which attack surface reduction capability should you use?"
    choices:

      explanation: "That's incorrect. Web protection can be applied to web browsers but not custom apps."

      explanation: "That's incorrect. In warn mode, the action is blocked although the user sees a prompt and can choose to continue with it."
    - content: "Audit mode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In audit mode, the event is logged but the action is permitted to continue."
