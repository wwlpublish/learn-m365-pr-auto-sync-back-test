Once you've rolled out Teams with chat, teams, channels, and apps across your organization, you're ready to add the meetings workload, including audio conferencing, video, and sharing.

Teams offers two kinds of meetings: channel meetings and private meetings.

If a team has a dedicated channel in Microsoft Teams, they can schedule a channel meeting. Channel meetings have multiple benefits:

- All members can see and join a meeting.
- Any meeting-related discussions before, during, or after the meeting are part of the channel discussion.
- Non-private meetings and discussions are visible to anyone who is a member of the team.
- Meetings can also be started ad-hoc from the existing channel conversation.

For instances where meetings involve non-team members, users can schedule a private meeting. Private meetings have these benefits:

- They are visible to invited people only.
- They can be started ad-hoc from existing chat conversations.
- They can be scheduled from the Teams client or Outlook add-in.
- Meeting-related discussions before, during, or after the meeting are accessible via chat.

## Access meetings from multiple clients

Teams meetings are accessible from multiple clients, including desktop and mobile clients and Microsoft Teams rooms. In addition, by using audio conferencing, participants can attend meetings from regular phones.
