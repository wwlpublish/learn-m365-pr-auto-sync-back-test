Although the features available in Microsoft Teams out-of-the-box are broad and adaptable, specialist or unusual companies might find they need extra features. To add such features to Teams, you can use Apps.

Suppose, in your multi-national organization, you have several development teams that use Agile coding practices. You want to manages these projects in Microsoft Teams. You have located a third-party Teams app that provides Agile project management functionality, such as feature backlogs and customer feedback management. You want to add the app to your Teams deployment.
Here, you'll learn how to add apps to Teams and manage their use.

## What are apps in Teams?

Apps provide additional functionality for Microsoft Teams. They provide collaboration and workflow functionality in tabs, messaging extensions, connectors, and bots. Apps may be provided by Microsoft, built by a third-party, or by developers in your organization.

You manage apps for Teams in the Teams admin center. You can allow or block apps at the organization level, set policies to control which apps are available to Teams users, and customize Teams by pinning the apps that are most important to your users.

Managing apps in the Teams Admin Center starts with a comprehensive catalog of all the apps available – including third-party apps, those from Microsoft and apps from your organization.

The App permission policy allows to curate this list of apps for end-users when they search for apps or view the app store.

## Getting started with managing apps

To manage apps:

1. Sign into the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com), and select **Team apps** from the left navigation bar.
1. Select either **Manage apps**, **Permission policies**, or **Setup Policies**.
1. From the **Manage apps** screen, you can control what apps are available to users in your organization's app store. You can then use app permission and app setup policies to configure what apps will be available for specific users.
1. From the **App permission policies** screen, you can control what apps you want to make available to Teams users. Use the Global (Org-wide) default policy and customize it, or you can create one or more custom policies and assign them to specific users, or groups of users.
1. From the **App setup policies** screen, you control how apps are made available to a user with the Teams app. You can use the Global (Org-wide default) policy and customize it or you can create custom policies and assign them to a set of users.

## App permission policies

With app permission policies, you can control what apps are available to specific users. You can allow or block all apps or specific apps published by Microsoft, third-parties, and your organization. For example, you can use app permission policies to:

- Gradually roll out new third-party or custom-built apps to specific users.
- Simplify the user experience, especially when you start rolling out Teams across your organization.

## Custom app policies and settings

As an admin, you can use app setup policies to do the following:

- Customize Teams to highlight the apps that are most important for your users. You choose the apps to pin and set the order that they appear. Pinning apps lets you showcase apps that users in your organization need, including those built by third parties or by developers in your organization.
- Control whether users can pin apps to Teams.
- Install apps on behalf of users (in preview). You choose which apps are installed by default for users when they start Teams. Users can still install apps themselves if the app permission policy that's assigned to them allows it.
