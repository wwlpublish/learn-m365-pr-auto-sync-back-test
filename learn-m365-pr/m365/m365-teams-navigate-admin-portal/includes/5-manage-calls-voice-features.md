Microsoft Teams can host audio and video calls over internet connections and can conference multiple users in single calls. Users can become frustrated if these calls and conferences suffer from poor audio quality and drop-outs. The Teams admin portal includes features for monitoring calls and managing settings.

Suppose, in your multi-national organization, you've experienced a recent increase in video conferencing use as your teams have expanded into new locations, remote from your regional headquarters. Some of your users have complained of poor audio and jumpy video in these conferences and you want to determine the cause of these problems.

Here, you'll learn about tools in the Teams admin portal for monitoring and controlling voice features.

## The Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)

The *Call Quality Dashboard* shows data for call and meeting quality for Microsoft Teams, Skype for Business Online, and Skype for Business Server 2019. Data is shown for the organization, and data is collected after the first sign in.

The CQD provides a summary view of your organization's calls and meetings - on a monthly, daily, or hourly. It allows you to investigate problems based on quality, failure, and in-product user feedback.

The near real-time data enable to drill down to find from where the issue is, and who was impacted, for faster resolution of troubleshooting efforts.

Sign into the Microsoft Call Quality Dashboard using your admin credentials. Alternatively, sign into the Teams admin center, and select **Call quality dashboard** from the left ribbon. You will be prompted to sign into the Call Quality Dashboard.

Once you have signed in, CQD will start collecting and processing data. It will take several hours to process enough data to display meaningful reports.

### Summary reports

When you first sign into the CQD, you will see the summary reports. These show daily and monthly call quality trends. **Call quality** is classified as good, poor, or unclassified. In the **Product Filter**, select Microsoft Teams.  Using the tabs, select **Overall Call Quality**, **Server-Client**, **Client-Client**, or **Voice Quality SLA**.

## Voice features

You can manage your voice devices from the Teams admin center. Voice provides private branch exchange (PBX) capabilities, and options for connecting to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). You can view and manage the device inventory for your organization and update, restart, and monitor diagnostics for devices. You can also create and assign configuration profiles to a device or groups of devices.

A device is automatically enrolled the first time a user signs into Teams on the device. These devices are managed the in the Microsoft Teams admin center and each type has a section under **Devices** in the left navigation bar.
