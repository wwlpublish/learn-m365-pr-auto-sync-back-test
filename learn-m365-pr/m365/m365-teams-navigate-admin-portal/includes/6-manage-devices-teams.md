In the modern workplace, users no longer connect to your systems only from a desktop or laptop computer that you have issued to them. Instead, they connect using phones, tablets, and other devices, some of which they own. In Microsoft Teams, you need a way to manage all these devices types.

In your multi-national organization, you've recently conducted a survey to find out how users connect to Teams. You've discovered that they use company-issued computers and their own mobile phones and tablets from various manufacturers. You're concerned that some of these devices may represent a security risk and you want to control the users' access.

Here, you'll learn how to impose configurations on devices that access Teams.

## Management tasks for devices

The Microsoft Teams admin center allows administrators to manage devices that are used with Teams. Management capabilities include:

- Setting up devices. A new device will automatically appear in the Teams Admin Center.
- Granular management. Admins can create and assign configuration profiles, and remotely apply settings on devices.  
- View enrolled devices. Track device inventory using organized views. Admins can scale management operations by using custom tagging.  
- Perform bulk actions. Manage device restarts and apply settings by using filters and search to define groups of devices.
- Device health monitoring, including network connectivity, sign-in status, and connected peripherals for Teams Rooms.  
- Alerting capabilities, including triggering a notification to an IT admin when an issue occurs.  
- Analyze call quality details, investigate, and diagnose poor audio calls, which can provide insights into additional actions.

For a list of Teams certified devices, see the online documentation.

- Personal devices:
  - Teams phones
  - Teams Displays
- Shared devices:
  - Microsoft Teams Rooms for Windows
  - Collaboration bars
  - Teams Conference phones

All these devices are managed the in the Microsoft Teams admin center and have their own respective sections in the left navigation under Devices. This lets you manage each type of device separately.
