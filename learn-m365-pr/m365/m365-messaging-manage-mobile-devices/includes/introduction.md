In modern IT infrastructures, users want to access their Outlook mailbox from their own mobile phones and tablets, as well as from devices issued by your organization. You need versatile methods to enable a broad range of clients while you ensure security.

Suppose you work for a retail company and have recently moved all users to Microsoft 365. Access to email and other functions through Outlook on desktop and laptop computers is working well, but traveling users are asking for access from their own mobile phones and tablets. Your company doesn't own these devices, and there are many different types. You want to enable as many users as possible to use their mobile devices, but your CIO is concerned about security and compliance with data protection regulations.

When you're done with this module, you should be able to:

- Enable mobile users to access Exchange Online
- Describe how mobile authentication works
