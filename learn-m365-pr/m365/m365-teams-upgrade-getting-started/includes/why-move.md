## Why upgrade to Microsoft Teams?

Microsoft Teams extends the capabilities of Skype for Business, bringing together chat, meetings, calling, collaboration, app integration, and file storage into a single interface. This new central hub for teamwork can help streamline the way users get things done, improving user satisfaction and accelerating business outcomes. We're continually expanding Teams' capabilities to enable you to communicate and collaborate in new ways, break down organizational and geographical barriers, and drive efficiency in process and decision making.

## Why do I need upgrade guidance? Can't I just delete/decommission Skype for Business?

Upgrading from Skype for Business to Teams is more than a technical migration. It represents a transformation in how users communicate and collaborate, and change isn't always easy. The ideal upgrade approach should address the technical aspects of your upgrade and encourage user acceptance and adoption of Teams, driving a positive user experience and business outcome realization.

## Can we continue to use Skype for Business Online as we prepare for and execute our upgrade to Teams?

Yes, Microsoft offers several options for running Skype for Business Online and Teams together. These coexistence modes allow your users to become familiar with Teams today while helping accelerate your upgrade to Teams.
