If your organization is upgrading from Skype for Business on-premises, you'll need to set up hybrid connectivity between Skype for Business Server and Teams or Skype for Business Online. Setting up hybrid connectivity is the first step in moving your on-premises environment to the cloud.

Teams users who also use on-premises Skype for Business (side by side) cannot interoperate with Skype for Business users nor communicate with users in federated organizations from their Teams client. To gain this functionality in Teams, these users must be moved from Skype for Business on-premises to the cloud, which requires configuring Skype for Business hybrid mode. For the best experience, these users should be in TeamsOnly mode. This ensures all incoming calls and chats from Skype for Business or Teams land in the user's Teams client.

Setting up hybrid connectivity and moving all users to the cloud is also required before you decommission your on-premises Skype for Business deployment. With hybrid connectivity set up, you can choose to move your users to the cloud based on your schedule and business need. With Direct Routing, you can leverage your on-premises voice infrastructure while you move to the cloud and after your migration is complete.
