**Manageable work levels**: Employees with an increase of 4+ hours in both collaboration hours and workweek span may be experiencing difficulty managing their workloads, and may benefit from task prioritization and workload balancing.

**Sustained working cadence**: Employees with a significant decrease in virtual collaboration may not be equipped with the tools (laptop, internet, or VPN) or resources and direction required to get their work done remotely. They may benefit from better tools, training, and guidance.

**Work-life integration**: Employees may find it difficult to create boundaries between work and home when both are taking place in the same environment. Creating team expectations around virtual collaboration norms and sharing best practices on creating boundaries may help maintain well-being. 

**Manager guidance**: Regular manager one-on-ones are critical for establishing rapport, creating an environment of empathy and trust, and managing workloads. Employees with regular one-on-ones may see less increase in collaboration hours and workweek span in the shift to  remote work.

**Employee connectivity**: Studies show that remote workers are at a significant risk of isolation. Ensuring peer connectivity through small group conversations increases employee engagement and reduces the risk of isolation.

Opportunities with high percentages of your employee population suggest high impact areas for remote work improvement. The Workplace Analytics metrics selected for each of these areas can indicate potential opportunity but are not definitive.

Use surveys, focus groups, and employee discussions to identify whether the changes in collaboration behaviors are truly indicative of an underlying issue.
