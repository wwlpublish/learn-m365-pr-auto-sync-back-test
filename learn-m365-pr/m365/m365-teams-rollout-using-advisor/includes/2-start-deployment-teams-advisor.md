*Microsoft Advisor for Teams* is a smart guide to deploying Microsoft Teams. It helps you to:

- **Plan and implement** your Microsoft Teams rollout based on information from your environment.
  - Select what workload you want to roll out and who will roll it out with.
  - A tenant readiness assessment is provided to quickly identify deployment friction points.

- **Get organized** by creating a Deployment team in Teams and adding a channel for each workload you select.

- **Identify tasks** that need to be done, and help you manage the process.

Advisor for Teams assesses your Microsoft 365 organization environment and identifies the configurations you might need to update, or modify, to roll out Teams.

Advisor for Teams creates a Deployment team with channels for each workload you want to roll out. Each workload in the Deployment team comes with a comprehensive plan in Planner that includes all the rollout tasks for your chosen workload. You'll use this plan to assign tasks to the people responsible for each phase. The roles include the project manager, Teams service admins, support people, and your adoption and user readiness team. Each part of the rollout contains all the guidance and resources you need to complete the task.

Creating those engage teams with a clear mission and tasks also helps to harness more attention to Teams and helps with adoption efforts.

## Create a Deployment team

The first time that Advisor for Teams is run, it will create a **Deployment team** in Teams. It also adds a channel for each selected workload. If a Deployment team is already in place and another user tries to create it, they'll get an error telling them to contact their support team. This message prevents Teams from unintentionally releasing information about the existing team and its members. The user can then ask the owner of the Deployment team to add them or contact support for more help.
