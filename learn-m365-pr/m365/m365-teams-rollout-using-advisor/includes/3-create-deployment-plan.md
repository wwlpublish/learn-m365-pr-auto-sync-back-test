When you create a **Deployment plan**, you're prompted to select the workloads you want to roll out in your organization. Choose one or more from the following list:

- Chat, teams, channels, and apps
- Meetings and conferencing
- Skype for Business upgrade

Before making your selection, look at the assessment checks against each workload. The score is based on how your configuration compares to best practice configurations. A warning identifies a potential problem that you might need to resolve. In the **Details** column, select **View** to preview the workload details.

A good place to start is with the **Chat, teams, channels, and apps** workload. When you've deployed that workload, you can go back to Advisor for Teams, and select **Add channel** to start the next one.

## Components of each workload

For each workload, Advisor for Teams provides the following plans:

- Tenant assessment
- Planner plan, including adoption tasks
- Forms user survey
- Advisor for Teams bot

For the Skype for Business update, the plan also guides you through the step-by-step process using a proven success framework. The plan  also provides online guidance and best practices, downloadable assets, live planning workshops, and additional resources to support your success.
