In the previous unit, you saw how Advisor for Teams creates a Deployment team. You also learned how to add team members to the Deployment team.

After Advisor for Teams has created your Deployment team, a welcome message is delivered in the **General** channel of everyone in the Deployment team. Your team is now ready to start work.

## Deployment Planner

Within the Deployment team, a Planner is created with tasks needed to roll out your chosen workload. This planner will guide you through each of the steps required to deploy Teams.

Select the Planner from the top menu in your workload channel.

The Planner has three views: **Board, Charts**, and **Schedule**. Use the Board view to see individual tasks. Use the Charts view to see summary visualizations including the number of tasks by status, by bucket, by user, and by priority. Use the Schedule view to see tasks with an assigned date on a calendar view.

### Assign users to tasks

The Deployment Planner creates tasks that you'll need to deploy your chosen workload successfully. Review each task and assign them to people in your team. You can amend and add new tasks or delete the ones you don't need. When you assign a task to someone, it will appear in their Planner.

### Use the project buckets

:::image type="content" source="../media/5-tasks-and-buckets.png" alt-text="Deployment planner tasks and buckets":::

Each task in the project is placed in a bucket. A bucket is a way of classifying tasks. You can use buckets in whatever way you want, such as project phases, types of work, departments, or another classification that helps you plan your work. The buckets created by Advisor for Teams are project phases. If you need to amend them, type over the name.
After a task has been worked on, you move it to the next phase, or bucket, by dragging. Open the task and select the down arrow to choose a new category. Add a new bucket by selecting **Add new bucket**.

### Forms user survey

Advisor for Teams creates a user survey to help you get feedback.
You use the survey form as it is or modify it to suit your specific requirements. Select **Preview** to see the survey as it will appear to users, either on their computer or on a mobile device.

When you're ready to get responses, amend the settings and generate a link to send to relevant users.

Use the responses to plan your communication and training programs, and to understand your users' priorities.
