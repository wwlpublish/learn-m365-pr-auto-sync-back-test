As we saw in the previous unit, Direct Routing allows you to use your own telephone provider with Microsoft Teams. This gives all the benefits of an existing phone system, including answering a call, putting a call on hold, and transferring calls.

In your clothing retail company, you're considering whether to use Direct Routing. You have a board meeting coming up, and you want to brief them on the benefits that a move to Direct Routing might realize.

Here, you'll learn about the advantages of Direct Routing over a third-party private branch exchange (PBX).

## Interoperability

Direct Routing gives you the option to use Teams with a third-party telephone system. If you're migrating from a legacy PBX, Direct Routing allows you to do it in stages.  Users on the legacy system can connect with Teams users. You can also carry on using your phone system during the migration.
Also, your existing telephone infrastructure might have unique features that are important to your organization. Direct Routing allows you to keep your infrastructure, with all its features linked to Phone System and Teams.

## Use existing contracts

Telephone contracts normally run for several years. If you have an existing contract, it might be difficult or expensive to terminate early. With Direct Routing, you can keep your existing contract and use it to link to Phone System and Teams.

## Single DIDs

If users in your organization have their own direct inward dial numbers (DIDs), and this is a feature you want to keep, Direct Routing allows you to replace this functionality. Everyone keeps their existing phone number.

## Reduced hardware footprint

Compared to Skype for Business, Direct Routing has a much-reduced hardware footprint. Cloud Connector Edition (CCE) isn't required.
