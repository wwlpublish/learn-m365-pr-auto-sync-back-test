Natural or human-made disasters can affect the continuity of an organization's cloud infrastructure at any time, without notice. Organizations must anticipate the possibility of disaster and then plan for recovery. Such planning is essential in helping to ensure protection against data loss.

However, data loss isn't the only disaster for which IT professionals must plan. A comprehensive disaster-recovery scheme also helps ensure business continuity across the organization. For example, a plan might involve redirecting requests or failing over to a secondary location when an application becomes unresponsive or a public cloud's entire region suffers an outage.

For this module, let's suppose you work for a financial organization that has offices across many different geo-locations. The organization recognizes the need to prepare a plan for data replication and recovery should an outage occur in one or more of these offices. 

Your specific role is to ensure that your organization's Azure infrastructure is correctly configured to address such a major challenge. Your first and main concern is protecting your existing Azure Virtual Desktop environment, which the organization's employees, who mostly work remotely, use to access critical company applications.

In this module, you'll learn how to adopt a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy for Azure Virtual Desktop. You'll also learn how to keep your company's apps and workloads running during planned and unplanned service or Azure outages.

## Learning objectives

After you've completed this module, you'll know more about:
- How to evaluate and identify a redundancy option for Azure Virtual Desktop. 
- How to plan an appropriate BCDR strategy to help protect against both unplanned and planned failures.

## Prerequisites

To get the best learning experience from this module, you should already have the following knowledge and experience:

- Intermediate-level knowledge of Microsoft Azure services, such as core Azure compute, storage, networking, and virtualization technologies.
- Intermediate-level knowledge of Azure operational concepts, such as monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- Familiarity with Azure Virtual Desktop.
- Familiarity with Windows virtualization technologies, including Remote Desktop Services.
- (Optional) Access to an Azure environment that's prepared for Azure Virtual Desktop. You must have Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) configured and integrated with Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), and an Azure virtual network that’s connected to your domain.
