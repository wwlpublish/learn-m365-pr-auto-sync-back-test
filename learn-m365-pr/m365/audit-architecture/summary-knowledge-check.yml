    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Which of the following protects customers from being adversely affected by other tenants using Microsoft 365 multi-tenant services?"
      choices:
      - content: "Network isolation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft 365 uses network isolation to prevent unnecessary communication between system components and create breach boundaries."
      - content: "Service isolation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft 365 uses service isolation to ensure each service is able to run independently of other services, increasing fault isolation."
      - content: "Tenant isolation"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Microsoft 365 implements tenant isolation to prevent the actions of one tenant from affecting the security or accessing the content of another tenant."
      
    - content: "Which Microsoft 365 security principle uses multiple security controls to provide increased protection?"
      choices:
      - content: "Assume Breach"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Assume breach is a principle that treats every entity in our services as a possible threat, including personnel administering the service, tenants using the service, and the service infrastructure itself."
      - content: "Defense-In-Depth"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Defense-In-Depth uses mutually reinforcing security controls for multiple layers of protection."
      - content: "Breach Boundaries"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Breach Boundaries prevent failure or compromise of one boundary in Microsoft 365 from causing compromise of other boundaries."
      
    - content: "How does Microsoft validate the architecture of Microsoft 365?"
      choices:
      - content: "Data flow diagrams"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While Microsoft 365 service teams document interconnections between service components using data flow diagrams, data flow diagrams do not themselves validate that the architecture has been implemented according to plan."
      - content: "Automated assessment"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Microsoft 365 uses automated architecture and configuration assessment tools to validate the architecture of Microsoft 365."
      - content: "Network isolation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft 365 uses network isolation to prevent unnecessary communication between system components and create breach boundaries."

    - content: "Which data resiliency principle involves shared responsibility between Microsoft 365 and our customers?"
      choices:
      - content: "Data criticality"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Our services prioritize the availability of critical data, such as customer data, without customer involvement."
      - content: "Granular monitoring and automated recovery"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Our systems automatically monitor customer data integrity and repair many types of data corruption without customer intervention."
      - content: "Protection against accidental loss"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Microsoft 365 provides customers with tools to recover accidentally deleted or modified data, but customers are responsible for configuring and using data recovery tools."

    - content: "Microsoft’s unique scale and global footprint bolster which aspect of DDoS defense?"
      choices:
      - content: "Absorption"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The scale and global distribution of Microsoft’s online services improve their ability to absorb DDoS attacks, increasing time available for detection and mitigation without loss of availability."
      - content: "Detection"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The scale and global distribution of Microsoft’s online services increase the time allowed for detection but do not directly contribute to detection capabilities."
      - content: "Mitigation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The scale and global distribution of Microsoft’s online services increase the time allowed for mitigation but do not directly contribute to mitigation capabilities."
