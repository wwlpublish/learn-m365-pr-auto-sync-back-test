Microsoft Phone System provides auto attendants and call queues, which can be used to let external and internal callers move through a menu system to locate and place or transfer calls to users or departments in your organization. These tools can be used to design and build a phone system that suits your exact business needs.

Suppose you're starting to plan how support calls will be handled by your phone system when it's moved to Microsoft Teams for your digital camera company. You want to investigate whether Teams can present the menu of options you've planned and whether it can handle the large volume of calls that you expect to receive at busy times.

Here you'll learn how Microsoft Teams can implement the required attendants and queues for your business.

## What is Phone System?

Phone System is the logical extension of Microsoft Teams that can work with or replace your existing private branch exchange (PBX) used by your staff to make internal and external calls.

With Phone System, users can use Teams to place, receive, and transfer calls using their mobile devices, a headset with a laptop or PC, or one of many IP phones that work with Teams and Skype for Business Online.

Calls between users in your organization are handled internally within Phone System, and never go to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). This applies to calls between users in your organization located in different geographical areas, which removes long-distance costs on these internal calls.

For calls outside your organization, Microsoft provides multiple options for connecting Phone System to the PSTN.

## What is the auto attendant service?

Phone System provides auto attendants, which can be used to let external and internal callers move through a menu system to locate and place or transfer calls to users or departments in your organization.

An auto attendant is the element of a phone system that gives a caller a series of voice prompts or audio files they hear instead of a human operator. When people call a number associated with an auto attendant, their choices can redirect the call to a user or locate someone in your organization and then connect to that user. They can express their choices and interact with the menu system by using a phone keypad or speech recognition. The choices they make can also redirect the call to another auto attendant, or to a call queue.
Auto attendants can:

- Deliver corporate or informational greetings.
- Provide custom corporate menus, which you can customize.
- Search a directory for a name.
- Enable callers to reach or leave a message for a person in your organization.
- Support multiple languages for prompts, text-to-speech, and speech recognition.
- Support specifying holidays and business hours.
- Transfer calls to an operator, other users, call queues, and auto attendants.
- Support shared voicemail for callers to leave a message for an organization.

## What are call queues?

Call queues organize calls into queues whilst alerting a group of users with a choice of different alerting methods.
Cloud call queues can provide:

- A greeting message.
- Music while people are waiting on hold.
- Redirection of calls to agents in mail-enabled distribution lists and security groups.
- Configuration parameters such as queue maximum size, timeout, and call handling options.
- Shared voicemail for callers to leave a message for an organization.

The following image shows what an attendant would see when a caller was in a call queue:
