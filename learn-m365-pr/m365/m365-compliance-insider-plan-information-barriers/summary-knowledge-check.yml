  title: Summary and knowledge check
  description: Information barriers enable administrators to define policies to allow or prevent communications between groups of users in Microsoft Teams chats and channels. When information barrier policies are in place, people who should not communicate with other specific users won't be able to find, select, chat, or call those users. With information barriers, checks are in place to prevent unauthorized communication.

    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "The primary use case of information barriers is represented in which of the following statements?"
      choices:
      - content: "An individual wants to keep their work private from the public. "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Simply keeping your information private is not an essential driver for using the information barriers in Office 365. "
      - content: "A department is handling information that should not be shared with other groups or departments."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Information barriers in Office 365 are policies that a compliance administrator or information barriers administrator can configure to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other."
      - content: "An organization wants to break down silos and allow searching across all business units."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Since information barriers are policies that a compliance administrator or information barriers administrator configure to prevent communication between groups, this is not a valid use case for information barriers."

    - content: "Instead of blocking communications between two segments, you decide you want to allow communications to occur between certain segments. What should you do?"
      choices:
      - content: "Edit a policy"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Edit an information barrier policy when you want to change how a policy works. "
      - content: "Edit a segment"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Edit segments when you want to change how a segment is defined. For example, you might have originally defined segments using Department and now want to use another attribute, such as *MemberOf*."
      - content: "Edit user account attributes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Edit user account attributes when users are not included in segments they should be, to change which segments users are in, or to define segments using different attributes."
      
    - content: "Can you use address book policies and information barrier policies at the same time?"
      choices:
      - content: "Yes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Information barriers are based on address book policies, but the two kinds of policies are not compatible. If you do have such policies, make sure to remove your address book policies first. Once information barrier policies are enabled and you have hierarchical address book enabled, all users who are not included in an information barrier segment will see the hierarchical address book in Exchange Online."
      - content: "No"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Information barriers are based on address book policies, but the two kinds of policies are not compatible. If you do have such policies, make sure to remove your address book policies first. Once information barrier policies are enabled and you have hierarchical address book enabled, all users who are not included in an information barrier segment will see the hierarchical address book in Exchange Online."
      - content: "Only when address book policies were in place first"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Information barriers are based on address book policies, but the two kinds of policies are not compatible. If you do have such policies, make sure to remove your address book policies first. Once information barrier policies are enabled and you have hierarchical address book enabled, all users who are not included in an information barrier segment will see the hierarchical address book in Exchange Online."
