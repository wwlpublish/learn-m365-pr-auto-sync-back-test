## Default sharing link type

When users share OneDrive files and folders, they can choose from **Anyone* (if enabled), **People in your organization**, or **Specific people** links. As an administrator, you can choose which link type is set as the default in the sharing dialog.

For example, you could enable **Anyone** links but not make that the default link type. This allows users to still select it if they choose but not accidentally share something by default to too many people.

- **Specific people**. This option allows users to enter external email addresses. This is the best option for external sharing of sensitive or proprietary information because it requires that the recipient verify their identity before they can access the file.
- **Only people in your organization**. Forwarded links will work for anyone in the organization. This option is best if your organization shares broadly internally and rarely shares externally.
- **Anyone with the link** This option is available only if you set external sharing setting to **Anyone**. This is the best option for friction-free sharing if most files and folders in OneDrive aren't sensitive.

## Default sharing link permission

The default sharing link permission can be set to either **View** or **Edit**. The user can change it from **View** or **Edit** within the sharing experience prior to sharing.
