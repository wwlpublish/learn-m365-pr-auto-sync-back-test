People regularly send, receive, and share attachments, and it's not always easy to tell whether an attachment is safe or malicious just by looking at the email message. ATP helps prevent malicious attachments from infiltrating your organization.

### Set up (or edit) an ATP Safe Attachments policy
1.	Go to https://protection.office.com and sign in with your work or school account.
2.	In the Security & Compliance Center, in the left navigation pane, under **Threat management**, choose **Policy > ATP safe attachments**.
3.	If you see **Turn on ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams**, select this option. This will enable ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams for your Microsoft 365 environment.

## Configure and manage ATP Safe Links
ATP Safe Links, a feature of ATP, helps protect your organization from malicious links used in phishing and other attacks. If you have the necessary permissions for the Security & Compliance Center, you can set up ATP Safe Links policies to help ensure that, when people click URLs, they’re taken to a warning page, and your organization is protected. 

>[!NOTE]
> The Safe Links web page contains a link to allow the user to continue to the website if they choose to ignore the warning. 

### Define (or review) the ATP Safe Links policy that applies to everyone
1.	Go to https://protection.office.com and sign in with your work or school account.
2.	In the left navigation, under **Threat management**, select **Policy > Safe Links**.
3.	In the **Policies that apply to the entire organization** section, select **Default**, and then select **Edit**.

### Add (or edit) ATP Safe Links policies that apply to specific email recipients

1.	In the **Policies that apply to specific recipients** section, select **New**.
