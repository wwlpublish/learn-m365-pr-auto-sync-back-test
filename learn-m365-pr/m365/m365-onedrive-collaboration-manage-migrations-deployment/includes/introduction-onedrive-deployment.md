Deploying OneDrive effectively in your organization is a multiple phase process that involves multiple teams. Your deployment strategy will need to address the sync app, the network, security and compliance rules, and administration of OneDrive as new features and controls are developed.

Deployment also means understanding the available OneDrive features that help ensure security, governance, and overall management for OneDrive as well as drive usage of all available functionality. Plus, you'll need to understand how OneDrive impacts other solutions and your existing environment.  

Start by asking specific questions that will help formulate your plan:

- **Is your network ready?** Cloud-based file management will add more stress to your network, especially if you enable automatic existing file syncing through Known Folder Move.
- **What devices will access OneDrive?** Your deployment plan will need to account for mobile, Windows, and macOS devices.
- **How will the rollout occur?** Utilize pilots and phases in your roll-out to inform future phases and ensure smooth user experiences.
- **What is your sharing strategy?** OneDrive uses the SharePoint architecture, which means your sharing strategy needs to align on both platforms along with Microsoft 365 groups and Microsoft Teams.
- **What is your sync strategy?** OneDrive employs Known Folder Move and Files On-Demand that define the way users sync files on their devices and the demands on your entire network environment.
- **Will you migrate any existing files?** You'll need to know where users' existing personal files are located.
- **Where are your users located geographically?** Different regions will most likely have different network topologies along with other scenarios you need to account for such as language, existing file location, and data residency requirements.
- **Do you have SharePoint on-premises? Or hybrid?** If your organization uses OneDrive or MySites in SharePoint Server, you might want to consider deploying hybrid OneDrive. OneDrive allows for seamless navigation to OneDrive in the cloud from both SharePoint on-premises and OneDrive in Microsoft 365.

The answers to these questions will help you build your deployment strategy. Once you have a strategy and plan be sure to sell them within your organization to reduce the impact of a OneDrive rollout.
