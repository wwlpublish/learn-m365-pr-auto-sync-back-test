  questions:

  - content: "An administrator at Contoso wants to use device identification as a way to enforce Conditional App Access Control in Cloud App Security.

Which of the following can also be used?"
    choices:
    - content: "Whether a device is AD DS joined."
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Whether a device is Azure AD joined."
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "An administrator at Contoso wants to use device identification as a way to enforce Conditional App Access Control in Cloud App Security. The administrator knows that client certificates in a trusted chain can be used to make a determination around access or session policies that implement device state as a filter. The administrator starts to upload root CA certificates to the Cloud App Security portal. What format do the certificates need to be?"
    choices:
    - content: "Certificates must be in the .CER format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: " That's incorrect. Certificates cannot be uploaded in this format."
    - content: " Certificates must be in the PEM format."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You can upload Root CE certificates and intermediate CA certificates in this format."
    - content: " Certificates must be in the P7B format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Certificates cannot be uploaded in this format."

  - content: "When an administrator starts to deploy Conditional Access App Control with AD FS as the identity provider, they create a new AD FS Relying Party Trust and App Single Sign-On configuration. Why is this necessary?"
    choices:
    - content: "To duplicate the existing configuration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: " That's incorrect. This procedure doesn’t duplicate the existing configuration."
    - content: "To create a secondary configuration, which is a requirement of this process."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You do not need a secondary configuration."
    - content: "To limit end-user downtime and preserve your existing known good configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. It’s a good idea to create a new Relying Party Trust and SSO configuration to limit user inconvenience during setup, and to ensure your live configuration is unaffected."
