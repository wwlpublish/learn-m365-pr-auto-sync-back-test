  title: Manage security with Microsoft 365
  description: We live in an always connected, technology-driven world. Efficient security management is the foundation to managing your assets – in the cloud, on-premises, or across a hybrid environment. You need to proactively manage and secure your organization’s identities, devices, end points (both apps and data), and IT infrastructure. Microsoft 365 helps you secure your infrastructure with a focus on visibility, control, and guidance, and helps you consolidate from a plethora of specialized functions and tools, leveraging the shared intelligence, to keep your security teams focused on the most critical insights for their workloads.
