Power Business Intelligence, otherwise known as Power BI, is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Microsoft Excel workbook or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

In this module, you'll examine how to build a Power BI report and dashboard that meets your exact business needs and integrates and interacts with your business data.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe what Power BI is and how it's used by organizations.
 -  Describe how Power BI connects to data sources.
 -  Build and share a basic Power BI report and dashboard.
 -  Administer Power BI permissions, licensing, and row level security.
