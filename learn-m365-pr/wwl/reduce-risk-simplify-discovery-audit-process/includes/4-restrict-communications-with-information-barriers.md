Microsoft cloud services include powerful communication and collaboration capabilities. Businesses, however, may want to restrict communications between two groups to avoid a conflict of interest from occurring in your organization or to restrict communications between certain people to safeguard internal information. With information barriers, Microsoft 365 enables business to restrict communications among specific groups of users when necessary.

Information barriers (IB) are policies that an admin can configure to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other. When information barrier policies are in place, people who shouldn't communicate with other specific users won't be able to find, select, chat, or call those users. With information barriers, checks are in place to prevent unauthorized communication.

### Scenarios

The need for information barriers can apply across different business segments and industries. Some common scenarios include:

- Financial services: A primary driver for information barriers, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reviews information barriers and conflicts of interest within member firms and provides guidance as to how to manage such conflicts
- Education: Students in one school aren't able to look up contact details for students of other schools.
- Legal: Maintaining confidentiality of data obtained by the lawyer of one client from being accessed by a lawyer for the same firm representing a different client.
- Government: Information access and control is limited across departments and groups
- Professional services: A group of people in a company is only able to chat with a client or specific customer via federation or guest access during a customer engagement.

### Information barriers in Teams

Initially, information barriers apply to Microsoft Teams chats and channels only. In Microsoft Teams, information barrier policies determine and prevent the following kinds of unauthorized communications:

- Searching for a user
- Adding a member to a team
- Starting a chat session with someone
- Starting a group chat
- Inviting someone to join a meeting
- Sharing a screen
- Placing a call

If the people involved are included in an information barrier policy to prevent the activity, they won't be able to proceed. For more information, see [Information Barriers in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/information-barriers-in-teams).
