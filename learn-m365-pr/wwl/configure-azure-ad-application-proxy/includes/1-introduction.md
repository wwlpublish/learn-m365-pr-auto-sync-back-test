As the Enterprise Administrator of your organization’s Microsoft 365 environment, it's important that you know how to configure Azure AD Application Proxy. Azure AD Application Proxy supports remote workers by publishing on-premises applications that will be accessed over the internet. These applications can be published through the Azure portal to provide secure remote access from outside your network. This module examines the benefits of Application Proxy, the types of applications that work with it, and how it works.

You'll also learn about connectors, which make Azure AD Application Proxy possible. This module examines the installation and maintenance of connectors and the benefits of creating connector groups.<br>

This module also provides instruction on how to publish an on-premises app for remote access. Once an app is published, you must verify that it functions properly.<br>
