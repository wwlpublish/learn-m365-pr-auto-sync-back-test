    - content: "Microsoft AI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft AI crunches the massive amounts of security data that's captured from across Microsoft’s portfolio, but it doesn't power Threat Intelligence in Microsoft 365. Try again."
    - content: "Microsoft Threat Management"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Threat intelligence in Microsoft 365 is powered by the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph. It consumes billions of packets of information traffic across the Microsoft 365 network, uses artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, and integrates this data across different security products to address different attack scenarios."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer is searching for a product that will provide a powerful report that enables Fabrikam's Security Operations team to effectively and efficiently investigate and respond to threats. This report should allow the Security Operations team to drill down and understand details related to threats targeting Fabrikam's Microsoft 365 tenant. Which of the following Microsoft products will provide Fabrikam with this functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Threat Explorer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Threat Explorer provides a powerful report that enables an organization's Security Operations team to effectively and efficiently investigate and respond to threats. Where the Threat Dashboard provides C-level executives a broad view of the threat landscape, Threat Explorer enables security analysts and admins to drill down and understand details related to threats targeting their tenant."
    - content: "Microsoft Threat Dashboard"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Threat Dashboard provides C-level executives a broad view of the threat landscape, but it doesn't provide the detailed information Holly is seeking. Try again."
    - content: "Microsoft Threat Protection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft Threat Protection provides threat hunting features. It doesn't provide the information Holly is seeking. Try again."
  - content: "In Attack simulation training, which social engineering (simulation) technique provides a phishing attack that sends the recipient a message containing a URL, directs the user to a login site when the recipient selects the link, then displays what appears to be a well-known website so that the user believes they've accessed a real site?"
    choices:
    - content: "Link to malware"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In a Link to malware simulation, an attacker sends the recipient a message that contains a link to an attachment on a well-known file sharing site, such as SharePoint Online or Dropbox. When the recipient selects the URL, the attachment opens, and then arbitrary code, such as a macro, is run on the user's device to help the attacker install more code or further entrench themselves. Try again."
    - content: "Credential harvest"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In a Credential harvest simulation, an attacker sends the recipient a message that contains a URL. When the recipient selects the URL, they're taken to a website that typically shows a dialog box that asks the user for their username and password. The destination page is themed to represent a well-known website. By displaying what appears to be a well-known website, the goal of the phishing attack is to have the user actually believe they've accessed a real site."
    - content: "Drive-by-url"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In a Drive-by-url simulation, an attacker sends the recipient a message that contains a URL. When the recipient selects the URL, they're taken to a website that tries to run background code. This background code attempts to gather information about the recipient or deploy arbitrary code on their device. Try again."
