  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When running SetupDiag in offline mode, it reviews the log files and tries to determine the root cause of an upgrade failure. What else can SetupDiag do when it's run in offline mode?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automatically fix errors that occurred during the First boot phase"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. SetupDiag can't automatically fix errors that occurred during the First boot phase. Try again."
    - content: "Open the setupDiagResults.log file in the Event Viewer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can open the setupDiagResults.log file in Notepad, but SetupDiag doesn't open it in Event Viewer. Try again."
    - content: "Debug setup-related minidumps"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When running in offline mode, SetupDiag can also debug setup-related minidumps. Minidumps are created when the setup process comes across a condition that compromises a safe system operation."
  - content: "0xC1900101 is a frequently observed result code. It can be reported at any stage of the Windows 10 upgrade process, except for the downlevel phase. What error does this result code usually indicate?"
    choices:
    - content: "General operating system errors"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Result codes starting with 0x800 indicate general operating system errors. Try again."
    - content: "Failure to complete writing data to the system drive, possibly because of write access failure on the hard drive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't what result code 0xC1900101 indicates. Try again."
    - content: "An incompatible driver is present"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. 0xC1900101 is a generic rollback code. This result code usually indicates that an incompatible driver is present. The incompatible driver can cause blue screens, system hangs, and unexpected restarts."
  - content: "Whether Windows Setup fails or completes successfully, the result and extend code are written as an informational event. Where is this event written to?"
    choices:
    - content: "the Security event log"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This log file isn't where the event is written to. Try again."
    - content: "the Application event log"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Whether Windows Setup fails or completes successfully, the result and extend code are written as an informational event in the Application log."
    - content: "the System event log"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This log file isn't where the event is written to. Try again."
