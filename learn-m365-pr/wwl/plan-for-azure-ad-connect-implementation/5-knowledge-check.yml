  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You're the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys. Tailspin wants to have extra servers for disaster recovery purposes. How can this requirement be achieved?"
    choices:
    - content: "Install multiple Azure AD Connect servers connected to a single Azure AD or Microsoft 365 tenant"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This process won't provide extra servers for disaster recovery purposes. Try again."
    - content: "Install an extra Azure AD Connect server(s) in staging mode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If a disaster occurs and the primary server fails, you can fail over to the staging server that was defined in the Azure AD Connect wizard."
    - content: "Install Active Directory Federation Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This process won't provide extra servers for disaster recovery purposes. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, you're planning to install Azure AD Connect. Tailspin's Active Directory has less than 100,000 objects. Where should you install Azure AD Connect?"
    choices:
    - content: "You must plan for another SQL Server to manage the database and load"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You must plan for another SQL Server to manage the database and load only when your AD has more than 100,000 objects. Try again."
    - content: "You can use more than one Azure AD Connect server connected to a single Azure AD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can't use more than one Azure AD Connect server connected to a single Azure AD. However, that has no bearing on where to install Azure AD Connect. Try again."
    - content: "You can use the light version of SQL Server Express that will be installed on the Azure AD Connect server"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When you have less than 100,000 objects in your AD, you can use the light version of SQL Server Express that will be installed on the Azure AD Connect server."
