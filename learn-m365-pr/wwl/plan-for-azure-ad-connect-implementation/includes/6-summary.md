This module examined the planning aspects that must be considered when running Azure AD Connect to implement directory synchronization with Microsoft 365. You learned about the importance of planning directory synchronization to synchronize your on-premises Active Directory objects to Azure AD.

To prepare for synchronization, you learned the importance of preparing your environment by analyzing the following features:

 -  Active Directory preparation
 -  UPN suffixes
 -  Microsoft 365 readiness checks
 -  Microsoft 365 IdFix tool

Because Azure AD Connect is the Microsoft 365 directory synchronization tool, planning to implement this tool is of utmost importance. You learned that while it's easy to implement Azure AD Connect, organizations that have a complex Active Directory implementation or special requirements must thoroughly plan the Azure AD Connect tool implementation. You also learned that planning is especially important in a multi-forest environment, which brings an entirely new level of complexity to the synchronization process.
