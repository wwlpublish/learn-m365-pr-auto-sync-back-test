Data loss prevention (DLP) is an important issue for organization message systems because of the extensive sharing of sensitive information in business-critical communication. To enforce compliance requirements for sensitive data without hindering user productivity, you can use Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention features to help protect and manage sensitive data.

This module describes data loss prevention features that can help you identify and monitor sensitive information categories that you have defined within your policies.
These features help you create or change DLP policies. You can include rules that include checks for sensitive information such as private identification numbers or credit card numbers. You can also create custom conditions within a policy, such as how many times something has to be found before an action is taken or exactly what that action is.
