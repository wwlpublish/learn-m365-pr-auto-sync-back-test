To ensure analytics are running at peak performance, Autoscale provides the ability to automatically increase V-cores one at a time for 24-hour when the load on total utilization capacity exceeds limits, preventing slowdowns caused by overload. V-cores are automatically removed when idle time is detected to prevent cost overages. Additional v-cores will be charged to your Azure subscription on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Autoscale acts as an optional safety net for organizations, transferring the impact of unplanned outages to additional IT cost.
