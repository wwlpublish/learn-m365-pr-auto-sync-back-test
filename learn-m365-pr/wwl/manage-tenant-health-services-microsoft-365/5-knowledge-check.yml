As the Enterprise Admin, which of the following steps should you complete to develop an incident response plan?"
    choices:
    - content: "Review for timeline checks once relevancy and degradation have been established"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This step determines whether the service group has set a specific timeframe on when they expect the service to be in a non-degraded state. If no timeline has been set for the incident, you can submit a service request to see if there's an opening on the timeline.
