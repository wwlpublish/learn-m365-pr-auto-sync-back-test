Security and compliance solutions are important if your organization is concerned about protecting its data or following legal or regulatory standards. For example, you want to make sure that nobody in your company sends out company-confidential information using e-mail.

While the reasons to implement security and compliance solutions depend on your company’s focus, the following guideline is available: [Office 365 security roadmap: Top priorities for the first 30 days, 90 days, and beyond](https://support.office.com/article/office-365-security-roadmap-top-priorities-for-the-first-30-days-90-days-and-beyond-28c86a1c-e4dd-4aad-a2a6-c768a21cb352?azure-portal=true).

### Plan for security and compliance in Microsoft 365

Managing security and compliance is a partnership. An organization is responsible for protecting its data, identities, and devices. At the same time, Microsoft is vigorously protecting Microsoft 365 services. Microsoft 365’s Enterprise Mobility + Security suite is designed to help organizations achieve the appropriate level of protection for their businesses.

The following table identifies the high-level steps that organizations should complete when planning for security and compliance in Microsoft 365.

After setting up your Microsoft 365 subscription, take note of your starting score within the ComplianceScore tool. Compliance Score provides Microsoft 365 configuration suggestions that your organization can implement to increase its score. The goal is to be aware of opportunities that you can take to protect your environment without negatively affecting the productivity of your users.

### Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center - still in service

For businesses to make sure they’re safe when it comes to security and compliance, Microsoft had an excellent solution known as the Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance center (SCC). It has since been replaced by two separate software solutions:

 -  Microsoft 365 Defender portal
 -  Microsoft 365 Compliance Center

However, while the SCC is in the process of being replaced by these two separate solutions, that replacement is still on-going. As a result, the SCC remains a viable tool for organizations to use. In fact, if you select **Security** in the navigation pane on the Microsoft 365 admin center, you'll be redirected to the Security and Compliance Center. And several of the features (such as retention policies) in the new Defender for Cloud redirect you to the SCC as well.

So throughout this training, you'll often see references to the SCC, even though it's in the process of being replaced. And that's because the feature being discussed is still in the SCC and has yet to be fully transitioned to either the new Defender for Cloud or Compliance Center. Once the planned transitions are completed, the SCC will be retired. But for now, it's still a significant part of the Microsoft 365 security story.
