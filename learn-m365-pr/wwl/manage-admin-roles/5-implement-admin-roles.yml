  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Patti Fernandez is the new Messaging administrator for Lucerne Publishing. After several managers changed jobs, Patti investigated Lucerne's permission management model. Patti discovered that the previous administrator had assigned roles directly to users. As a result, Patti had to manually reassign those managers' roles to their replacements. Patti soon realized how inefficient and complex this process was. To avoid this situation in the future, what should Patti do to make it easier to manage role assignments and reduce the complexity of Lucerne's permission model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create new roles directly from scratch for each manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. It's recommended that you never create new roles directly from scratch. Try again."
    - content: "Assign roles to a universal security group (USG)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A USG is a role assignee, similar to a role group, role assignment policy, and user. Assigning a role to a USG would be similar to what Patti did by assigning roles to the new users. Try again."
    - content: "Use role groups and role assignment policies to give permissions to users"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. While you can also assign roles directly to users, it increases the complexity of your permissions model. For this reason, it's recommended that you use role groups and role assignment policies to give permissions to your users. You can assign the roles to a role group or role assignment policy, and then just add or remove members of the role group or change role assignment policies as needed."
