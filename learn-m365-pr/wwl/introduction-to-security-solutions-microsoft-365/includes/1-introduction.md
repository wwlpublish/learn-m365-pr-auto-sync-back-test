Attackers can use various threat vectors to access targets within an organization. They can methodically work their way from one step to another in the kill chain once a user or computer has been compromised.

This module introduces you to several features in Microsoft 365 that can help protect your organization against cyberthreats, detect when a user or computer has been compromised, and monitor your organization for suspicious activities. The feature areas that will be discussed in this training include:

 *  Exchange Online Protection
 *  Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (formerly Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection)
 *  Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence
 *  Auditing and alerts
 *  Advanced Security Management

This module provides a high-level overview of each of these areas, all of which will be discussed in greater detail in later training.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 *  Identify the features of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 that enhance email security in a Microsoft 365 deployment.
 *  Explain how Microsoft Defender for Identity identifies, detects, and investigates advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.
 *  Explain how Microsoft Defender for Endpoint helps enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.
 *  Describe how Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence can be beneficial to your organization’s security officers and administrators.
 *  Describe how Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps enhances visibility and control over your Microsoft 365 tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Threat Intelligence, Advanced Security Management, and most of the Alert capabilities require a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try these features, you can [sign up for a trial of Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=858586).
