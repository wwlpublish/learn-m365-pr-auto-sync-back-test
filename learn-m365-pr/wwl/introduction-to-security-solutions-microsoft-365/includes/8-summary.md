This module introduced you to several features in Microsoft 365 that can help protect your organization against cyberthreats, detect when a user or computer has been compromised, and monitor your organization for suspicious activities. The feature areas that were discussed in this training included:

* Exchange Online Protection
* Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (formerly Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection)
* Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence

* Advanced Security Management

This module provided a high-level overview of each of these areas. You learned about the three key Microsoft Defender products:

* Microsoft Defender for Identity, which identifies, detects, and investigates advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.
* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, which helps enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.

Along with the Microsoft Defender products, this module examined how Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence can be beneficial to your organization’s security officers and administrators.
