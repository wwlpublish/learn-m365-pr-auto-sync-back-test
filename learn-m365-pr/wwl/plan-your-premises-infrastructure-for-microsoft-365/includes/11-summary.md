As you plan your migration to Microsoft 365, it's essential you plan the on-premises infrastructure needed to support your migration to the Microsoft cloud. To support that planning effort, this module discussed some of the networking decisions that must be made to ensure an optimal migration experience, and the best experience for your users after migration.

To assist you as you plan your deployment, we recommended using a pre-deployment checklist. A checklist of this nature enables companies to create timelines and set goals and subtasks that will help keep their Microsoft 365 deployments on schedule. Having a model to follow improves quality of life by helping you manage key benchmarks so they don’t become insurmountable.

If your company has difficulty coming up with a planning checklist, Microsoft provides a Deployment Planning Checklist for Microsoft 365 that can get you started. You can then customize this list as per your organization's business requirements.
