Microsoft provides several tools to help organizations test and validate their upload, download, and latency constraints. These tools are designed to help organizations determine the capabilities of their networks for both migration and after they're fully deployed.

These network tools include:

 -  **Microsoft Message Analyzer.** Message Analyzer is an effective tool for troubleshooting network issues. Message Analyzer captures, displays, and analyzes protocol-based messaging traffic and system messages. Message Analyzer also lets you import, aggregate, and analyze data from log and trace files.
