You might have too many security solutions with various places to configure lots of controls and don't know which controls are the most effective and which will introduce new challenges for your workforce. It can be difficult for security teams to find the right balance of security and productivity.

## Microsoft Secure Score

Microsoft Secure Score is a representation of your organization’s security posture and your opportunity to improve it.
Following the Secure Score recommendations can protect your organization from threats. From a centralized dashboard in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, organizations can monitor and work on the security of their Microsoft 365 identities, data, apps, devices, and infrastructure.

Secure Score helps organizations:

* Report on the current state of the organization's security posture.
* Improve their security posture by providing discoverability, visibility, guidance, and control.
* Compare with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs).

Secure Score points are categorized into identity, data, device, apps, and infrastructure. You're given points for configuring recommended security features, performing security-related tasks, or addressing the improvement action with a third-party application or software, or an alternate mitigation.

Microsoft Secure Score shows you the full set of possible improvements, regardless of license, so you can understand security best practices and improve your score.  Keep in mind that security should be balanced with usability, and not every recommendation can work for your environment.

In the Microsoft Secure Score overview page, you can see how points are split between the various categories (identity, data, device, apps, and infrastructure and what points are available. The overview page is also the place to get an all-up view of the total score, the historical trend of your secure score with benchmark comparisons, and prioritized improvement actions that can be taken to improve your score.
