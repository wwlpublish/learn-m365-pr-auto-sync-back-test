As Fabrikam's Enterprise Administrator, you want to add a custom domain titled fabrikamresidences.com for the new subsidiary. You also want to register a subdomain titled content.fabrikamresidences.com. This subdomain will be under the fabrikamresidences.com root domain. What should you do to add these two domains to your Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription?"

    - content: "Register the subdomain first and then register the root domain"
