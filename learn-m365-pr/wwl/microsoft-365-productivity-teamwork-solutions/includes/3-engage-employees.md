The way we work is rapidly changing and with it, organizational culture is transforming. More and more people feel less connected to their team after moving to a remote workstyle. Today, organizations spend over **$300 billion a year on employee experience**, including development, training, benefits and wellbeing, along with a whole host of employee experience technologies.

But too often, these technologies are fragmented, hard to find, and disruptive to the flow of work. As digital tools become more crucial to a great employee experience, business leaders across every industry are embracing the opportunity to learn, and they’re re-evaluating both their spending and their approach.

There has never been a bigger need for technology, data and insights that are designed to create a great employee experience, regardless of where people are located.

 -  **Employees** want to feel more connected, more aligned to their company purpose and mission. They want to grow, make an impact, and make a difference.
 -  **Leaders** need a modern way to engage and develop their employees.
 -  **IT** needs to quickly enable a modern employee experience, for the new world of work, without having to rip and replace all their existing systems and tools.

A new approach and a new category of technology solutions called **Employee Experience Platforms (EXP)** are needed to overcome these challenges.

An EXP is a digital platform that puts people at the center by bringing together **systems of work** with **systems of support** into an integrated employee experience. It provides people with the resources and support they need to succeed and thrive, no matter their location.
