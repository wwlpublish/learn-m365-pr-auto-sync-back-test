  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What happens when Azure Identity Protection’s threat intelligence or advanced machine-learning algorithms indicate that a user’s credentials are compromised?"
    choices:
    - content: "Risk-based conditional access policies can be triggered"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When Azure Identity Protection’s threat intelligence or advanced machine-learning algorithms indicate that a user’s credentials are compromised, the risk-based conditional access policies can be triggered. These policies can offer either automatic remediation in the form of blocking the account or, with Multi-Factor Authentication, require a user-initiated password change."
    - content: "Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled for the user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the task that occurs when Azure Identity Protection’s threat intelligence or advanced machine-learning algorithms indicate that a user’s credentials are compromised. Try again."
    - content: "Azure Identity Protection notifies the Security Admin of the compromised credentials"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the task that occurs when Azure Identity Protection’s threat intelligence or advanced machine-learning algorithms indicate that a user’s credentials are compromised. Try again."
  - content: "When a risk event is created, which risk level identifies events that are potentially risky, and any affected user accounts should be remediated?"
    choices:
    - content: "High"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A high risk level event is a strong indicator that the user’s identity has been compromised, and any affected user accounts should be remediated. Try again."
    - content: "Medium"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A medium risk level event is a  potentially risky event, and any affected user accounts should be remediated."
    - content: "Low"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A low risk level event may not require an immediate action, but when combined with other risk events, it may provide a strong indication that the identity is compromised. Try again."
