Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is a cloud-based email filtering service. It provides anti-malware and anti-spam policies to protect organizations against spam and malware. EOP includes features to safeguard organizations from messaging policy violations.

This module will introduce you to EOP features and functionality. You'll also learn about the primary ways in which EOP can be used for messaging protection.

The module will then analyze the three different ways of deploying EOP:

You'll then learn how to configure mail flow using EOP in each of these deployment scenarios. The module concludes by introducing you to the types of reports that are available to help you determine the overall status and health of your organization.
