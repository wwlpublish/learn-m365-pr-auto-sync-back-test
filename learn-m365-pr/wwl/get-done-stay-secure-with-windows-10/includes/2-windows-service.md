Windows 10 is a comprehensive desktop operating system that allows you to work efficiently and securely. Keeping the desktop operating system up to date is important because it helps devices to run efficiently and stay protected.

Windows-as-a-Service (WaaS) is a new way to work with the Windows desktop. In the past, new features were released every few years, and required a significant effort to deploy. With Windows-as-a-Service, new features are released twice a year. By releasing new features in bite sized chunks, rather than major new versions, the work required by IT people is reduced.

The Windows-as-a-Service model is designed to make life simpler for both users and IT professionals. There are two types of updates: features and quality fixes.

## Feature updates

Feature updates are released twice a year. Because these updates are more frequent, they are smaller. This gives you a number of benefits:

 -  There is less disruption and effort to apply new features.
 -  Users are more productive with earlier access to new Windows features.
 -  Users take less time to adapt to smaller changes.
 -  The workload and cost impact of updating Windows is reduced.

## Quality updates

Quality updates include fixes and security patches. These are usually issued once a month. In addition, a cumulative update is released that includes all previous updates. There are several benefits from monthly quality updates:

 -  Identified security issues are fixed and deployed quickly, helping to keep devices secure.
 -  Everyone receives security fixes regularly, keeping all devices aligned.

## Servicing channels

Servicing channels are a method of controlling the frequency at which organizations deploy Windows 10 features. Servicing channels allow you to control how and when updates are applies. Windows-as-a-Service offers three servicing channels, each receiving feature updates at different frequencies:

 -  **Insider preview**. This channel receives Windows features before general release, often during development. This allows organizations to test and evaluate new features and provide feedback to Microsoft.
 -  **Semi-annual channel**. Feature updates are released to the semi-annual channel twice a year.
 -  **Long-term servicing channel**. Designed for specialist devices that do not run Office apps such as medical equipment or ATMs. These receive new features every two or three years.

## Deployment rings

Deployment rings are groups of devices that are used to pilot new features, before they are deployed to the rest of the organization.

## Manage Windows-as-a-Service

In Configuration Manager, you can view the state of Windows-as-a-Service (WaaS) in your environment. You can create servicing plans to form deployment rings and ensure that Windows 10 systems are kept up to date when new builds are released. You can also view alerts when Windows 10 clients are near end of support for their Semi-Annual Channel build.
