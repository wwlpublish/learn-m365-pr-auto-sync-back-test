There are a number of ways to deliver Windows updates, so consider which strategy is best for your organization.

To reduce bandwidth consumption, you can enable peer-to-peer content sharing. There are two peer-to-peer options for content distribution: **Delivery Optimization** and **BranchCache**.

Delivery Optimization allows Windows 10 clients to source content from other devices on their local network that have already downloaded the updates, or from peers over the internet. BranchCache is a bandwidth optimization technology included in some editions of Windows Server 2016, Windows 10 operating system, and some other operating systems. Using BranchCache, files are cached on each individual client, and other clients can retrieve them as needed.

Or, if your organization uses Windows Intune, Windows updates can be deployed using Intune.

This interactive guide introduces you to two ways to optimize the delivery of Windows 10 updates. You will learn how to:

 -  Reduce bandwidth consumption.
