Our accessibility efforts focus on the following accessibility standards (EN 301 549, U.S. Section 508, WCAG 2.0, ISO/IEC 40500). Here is a list of some of the key accessibility features available on Windows 10 and Microsoft 365.

## Vision

Need a larger screen? A brighter screen? A narrator to read text? Find out about accessibility tools and features for people who are blind, color blind, or have low vision. Here are some Microsoft 365 features that assist vision.

- **Color filters:** Boost contrast or get rid of color entirely—whether you have color blindness, light sensitivity, or a visual preference, with color filters you can customize your screen's color palette.

- **Tell Me:** Quickly access commands in several Microsoft 365 Apps without navigating the command ribbon. You can use Tell Me to assist with formatting, discover the difficult-to-find capabilities and even get scoped help in Microsoft 365 Apps using everyday language.

Plus, let each audience member follow along with captions displayed in their chosen language on any device with Microsoft Translator.

## Neurodiversity

Innovative tools such as dictation and Windows Hello sign-in can make the digital world more accessible for those who live with dyslexia, seizures, autism, or other cognitive differences.

## Learning
