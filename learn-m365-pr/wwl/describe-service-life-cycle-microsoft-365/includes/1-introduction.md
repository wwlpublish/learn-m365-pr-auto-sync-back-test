Every product or service has a lifecycle, that includes product and services in Microsoft 365. Microsoft envisions, designs, develops, and tests everything internally. Once these features, products, and services are mature enough they're made available to test by the public in a preview release. After these tests succeed the feature, product, or service is released and becomes generally available.

Products that are at General Availability (GA) are fully supported and have regular updates to ensure they're secure and fully functional. Over time as more and more product releases take place older products can no longer be supported and they'll reach the end of support.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the private preview, public preview, and general availability phases of a product lifecycle
- Describe the support implications of the lifecycle policy
- Describe the Microsoft 365 Roadmap
