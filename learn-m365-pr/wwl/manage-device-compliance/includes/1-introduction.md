This module examines how organizations manage device compliance. Many companies define how their devices should be configured. The following items are examples of compliance policies that organizations often use:

 -  All devices require a password or PIN.
 -  Devices should have local data encrypted.
 -  Devices should all run Windows 10.
 -  Access to company resources should be limited to just those devices that have been configured in this manner.
 -  Notify management of any devices that aren't configured in an expected way.

This module explores device compliance policies and how organizations effectively use them. If an organization's devices are managed by Intune, it can define how devices should be configured by using device compliance policies. After configuring and deploying a compliance policy, an organization can monitor device compliance status. It can also identify individual devices and information if they're configured in an expected way. Compliance policies are platform-specific. You can have multiple compliance policies that verify the same setting, but on different device types, such as Android and Windows 10.

Organizations can also use device compliance status for reporting. For example, reports can be generated that show which Windows 10 devices are using BitLocker or don’t have Windows Firewall enabled, and how many devices fall in these categories. Compliance information can also be used as one of criteria for Conditional Access. You can require that users only access email and other company resources from compliant devices.

In this module, you'll learn how to create policies and configure conditional users and groups to which whose policies will be applied. You'll also examine how to manage devices once they're enrolled to MDM. Managing devices includes monitoring them, verifying whether they're compliant, and generating various reports on the Intune view in the Azure portal or by using Power BI and the Intune data warehouse.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Plan for device compliance by defining the rules and settings that must be configured on a device for it to be considered compliant.
 -  Configure conditional users and groups for deploying profiles, policies, and apps.
 -  Create Conditional Access policies to implement automated access control decisions for accessing your cloud apps.
 -  Monitor enrolled devices to control their Intune activities and compliance status.
