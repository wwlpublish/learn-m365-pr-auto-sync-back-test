One of the main advantages of running an on-premises Exchange Server environment is that you can connect your environment in a seamless way to Exchange Online and Microsoft 365. This connection is called a hybrid deployment.

This module explored the following features associated with Exchange hybrid deployments:

 -  The requirements necessary to implement a hybrid deployment.
 -  Using Azure Active Directory Connect.
 -  The options for connecting on-premises Exchange to Microsoft 365.
 -  The Microsoft 365 identity options for Exchange hybrid.

This module also examined how a hybrid deployment allows you to move mailboxes between your on-premises and cloud environments and share a common global address list (GAL). Your users have the same experience, no matter if their mailbox is located on a local Exchange server or in Exchange Online.

You also learned that even if you don’t plan to migrate mailboxes from your on-premises environment to the cloud, a hybrid deployment still enables you to:

 -  Configure cloud-based online archives for your Exchange users.
 -  Benefit from Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) functionality.
 -  Enable users of services such as Microsoft Teams to benefit from rich, on-premises integration.
 -  Provide secure, remote access using Microsoft 365 technologies through Modern Hybrid Authentication.
