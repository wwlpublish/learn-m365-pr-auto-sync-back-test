One of the main advantages of running an on-premises Exchange Server environment is that you can connect your environment in a seamless way to Exchange Online and Microsoft 365. This connection is called a hybrid deployment.

A hybrid deployment allows you to move mailboxes between your on-premises and cloud environments and share a common global address list (GAL). Your users have the same experience, no matter if their mailbox is located on a local Exchange server or in Exchange Online.

Even if you don’t plan to migrate mailboxes from your on-premises environment to the cloud, a hybrid deployment still enables you to:

 -  Configure cloud-based online archives for your Exchange users.
 -  Benefit from Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) functionality.
 -  Enable users of services such as Microsoft Teams to benefit from rich, on-premises integration.
 -  Provide secure, remote access using Microsoft 365 technologies through Modern Hybrid Authentication.

In this module, you'll examine the requirements necessary to implement a hybrid deployment. You'll also learn about the features and components that are required when implementing a hybrid deployment.
