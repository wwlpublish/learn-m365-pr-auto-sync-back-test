The **Data classification** solution provides information about your organization's data once it has been classified. It helps you identify exposure and risks to inform policies that help you protect and govern your data. It not only helps during the process of getting to know your data. It also helps you monitor the status of your classification work on an ongoing basis. It was already covered in this learning path, so we will review the parts of the solution relevant to protecting your data.

These cards from the **Overview** page are most relevant to information protection:

- **Top sensitive information types**
- **Top sensitivity labels applied to content**
- **Top activities detected**
- **Locations where sensitivity labels are applied**
- **Azure Information Protection labels summary**

Each summary card except for **Azure Information protection labels summary** links to either **Activity explorer** or **Content explorer**, where you can examine the data more thoroughly.
