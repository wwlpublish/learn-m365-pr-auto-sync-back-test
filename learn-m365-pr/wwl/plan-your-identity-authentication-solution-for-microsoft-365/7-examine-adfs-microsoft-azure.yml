quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, you're planning to deploy ADFS for your Microsoft 365 deployment. Because the applications that require security tokens are often critical for Contoso, you're concerned about the failure of an application that AD FS enables. To address this concern, you want to make the AD FS service highly available, and you want to distribute application requests. Which of the following AD FS best practices will achieve these goals?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploy multiple AD FS nodes for high availability and balancing the load"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The AD FS service must be highly available through multiple AD FS proxies and AD FS servers. To achieve distribution of requests, load balancers are typically deployed in front of both the AD FS Proxies and the AD FS servers."
    - content: "Domain controllers should be deployed on the same network as the AD FS servers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While this best practice provides business continuity in case the link between the Azure network and your on-premises network breaks, it doesn't address your stated concerns. Try again."
    - content: "Never expose security token service (STS) servers directly to the Internet"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While this best practice is important because the STS role issues security tokens, it doesn't address your stated concerns. Try again."
