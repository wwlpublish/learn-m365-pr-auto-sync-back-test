quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to create a specific mailbox for the Sales department. Holly wants to create this mailbox so that members of the Sales department can access the messages directed to the department. This mailbox will enable the Sales department to centrally store, respond to, and manage messages. What recipient type should Holly create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Distribution group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Distribution groups are used to distribute messages to a set of users or contacts. The most common form of a globally available distribution list for sending out one-to-many e-mail messages or where you need to use the membership list elsewhere, such as to determine who Transport Rules should apply to. It can also be used for reaching out to a team as a contact address or used to allow send-as another email alias without creating a shared mailbox. Try again."
    - content: "Linked mailbox"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Linked mailboxes are user mailboxes that are associated with specific users in a separate, trusted forest. When you create a linked mailbox, a disabled user account is created in the Exchange organization, and a user account from a trusted forest is given access to the mailbox. Try again."
    - content: "Shared mailbox"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Shared mailboxes can be accessed by multiple users as an extra mailbox in Outlook. Team, department, or project mailboxes are used to centrally store, respond to, and manage messages. Organizations often use a shared mailbox to provide one specific mailbox for a dedicated group of people, such as sales, help desk, or general information requests."
