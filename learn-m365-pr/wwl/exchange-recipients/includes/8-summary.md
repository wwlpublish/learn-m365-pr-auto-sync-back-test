This module examined the different types of recipients that are available in Exchange Server, including:

 -  Mailboxes
 -  Microsoft 365 groups
 -  Resources
 -  Contacts

You learned how these recipient types differ from each other, and how recipients can be grouped together to improve collaboration.

The module also explored why Messaging administrators must understand the available recipient types to effectively manage Microsoft Exchange. You learned that two of the most common tasks completed by messaging administrators are creating and configuring email recipients. As organizations hire new employees or employees change positions within the organization, the messaging administrators must ensure the users have the messaging functionality they require.

Most users in an organization will use Exchange mailboxes. Exchange also provides various other mailbox options that administrators can configure. For example, you learned that:

 -  You can use a shared mailbox if you want your users to monitor and use one mailbox to receive and send emails (such as info@contoso.com).
 -  You can use a room mailbox if you want to allow your Outlook users to book a conference room from their calendar.
