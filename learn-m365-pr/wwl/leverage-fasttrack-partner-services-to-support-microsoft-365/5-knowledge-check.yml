  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, you're planning the company's migration to Microsoft 365. To help with this process, you want to use Microsoft's FastTrack service. Specifically, you want to use FastTrack's data migration service to move data and email from your on-premises file server to Microsoft 365. To do so, you must ensure that Fabrikam purchases enough licenses to qualify for the FastTrack data migration service. How many licenses should Fabrikam purchase?"

    - content: "50"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't the correct number of licenses that Fabrikam must purchase to meet its requirements. Try again."
    - content: "150"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't the correct number of licenses that Fabrikam must purchase to meet its requirements. Try again."
    - content: "500"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Customers with 150+ seats can request assistance from a FastTrack specialist (Microsoft employee or partner) to support their Microsoft 365 cloud deployment and adoption. However, to qualify for FastTrack's data migration service, customers must purchase at least 500 licenses. For customers with 500+ seats, FastTrack can perform the data/email migration for you, which frees up time for you to deploy more products at one time."
