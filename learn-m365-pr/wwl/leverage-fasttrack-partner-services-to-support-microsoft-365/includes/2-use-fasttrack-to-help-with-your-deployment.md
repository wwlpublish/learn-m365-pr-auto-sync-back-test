Microsoft is committed to helping IT professionals and partners get the tools, resources, and guidance needed to move with confidence to Microsoft 365, Azure, and Dynamics 365. That means helping an organization discover what’s possible, create a plan for success, and on-board new users and capabilities at a flexible pace. To help customers achieve these goals, Microsoft provides FastTrack, which is Microsoft’s customer success service for the Microsoft Cloud. FastTrack provides organizations with personalized assistance at any time, as long as its subscription is active.

Microsoft FastTrack specialists can work closely with both customers and partners during a FastTrack engagement. This teamwork helps customers benefit from all the resources and guidance available through FastTrack. With the purchase of an eligible subscription, customers, partners, or field staff can request assistance for FastTrack services. FastTrack provides customers and partners with a standardized, repeatable process to support successful deployments. Additionally, partners can combine their expertise with FastTrack services to provide best-in-class solutions to their customers’ plans.

### The FastTrack process

There are three phases to the FastTrack process - pilot, deploy, and enhance.

 -  **Pilot.** This phase defines the goals for a successful rollout by identifying and ranking key scenarios and creating a plan for success that uses planning templates and materials. Once engaged, an approved partner works with their customer to help build a plan that drives the achievement of their business goals. Local environment considerations and timelines are documented to prioritize resources. A FastTrack specialist can help review the plan and provide guidance about business goals, local infrastructure requirements (on-premises and to the cloud), timing, and resource needs.
 -  **Deploy.** This phase uses Microsoft’s digital resources or, if eligible, receives remote assistance from Microsoft engineers. FastTrack for Microsoft 365 helps customers deploy Microsoft 365 (Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) cloud solutions) and drive user adoption. FastTrack for Microsoft 365 offers:<br>
    
     -  Ongoing, repeatable benefit included in your subscription.
     -  Beginning to end guidance from Microsoft engineering.
     -  Delivered by Microsoft engineers or approved partners.
     -  Online resources and tools available to all customers.
     -  Available for Microsoft 365, Azure, and Dynamics 365.
 -  **Enhance.** This phase takes advantage of Microsoft’s robust set of tools, guides, and best practices that are tailored to users in various roles within an organization. When an organization begins using the FastTrack Center, its FastTrack engineer will run checks to identify any readiness tasks within its infrastructure that the organization must address before onboarding. These tasks may include providing more hardware for identity management, upgrading its infrastructure to supported software, or updating the network. During the pre-onboarding check, it may be determined that the organization needs extra assistance outside of the scope of the FastTrack engagement. If an organization doesn’t have a preferred partner to work with, it can choose to be contacted by a qualified partner for assistance.
