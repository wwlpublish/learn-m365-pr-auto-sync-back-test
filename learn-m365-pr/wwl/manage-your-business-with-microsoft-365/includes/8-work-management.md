Every organization, regardless of size, needs to have a plan for how its business, service offering, or products will evolve and grow. Regardless of which project management methodology you adopt, at the end of the day, for those projects to succeed, you'll need a means to share that information with your team and the project stakeholders.

## Microsoft Planner

Microsoft provides a project management tool to help you manage your projects and the teams working on them, called Microsoft Planner.

Planner lets you organize the activities in your project, starting with the overall plan, then assigning tasks to groups, known as buckets. Each task can be assigned a name or label, assigned to a team member, and given a deadline. Microsoft Planner uses Microsoft 365 Groups to give project team members access to the plan and be assigned tasks. Using Microsoft 365 groups, team members can collaborate on the plan and receive notifications when it changes.

Planner fully integrates into Teams and Outlook to ensure that all your team members are fully updated about the tasks and activities they are working on and status updates on the project.

Planner provides a simple and visual way for teams to organize their work. Customers can use Planner to create plans, organize and assign tasks, share progress, and collaborate on content. Planner provides several interactive experiences, including a task board, a charts page, and a schedule view, as well as integrations throughout the Microsoft 365 suite of tools, apps, and services.

### Board

The default view is the board, which shows each bucket and the associated tasks. This is where the team member will manage the tasks they are working on. They can move tasks between buckets, update the progress, add additional information to the task, including attachments, and mark a task as completed when it is done. The board has several tools available to filters to refine the view:

 -  Filter - Lets you narrow down what you see. Some of the options include, late, today, tomorrow, this week, next week, future, and tasks assigned to specific team members.
 -  Group by - lets you re-sort your tasks by bucket, assigned to, progress, due date, and any of the assigned labels.

### Charts

Lets you get a visual representation of the state of the project and tasks. This dashboard has three components, an overall status of all the tasks, the progress of jobs in each bucket, and the availability of team members.

### Schedule

Use the schedule view to see where each task falls on the calendar. From this view, you have the option to add the schedule to Outlook. Tasks can also be integrated into Microsoft To-Do, so each team member can see the tasks that have been assigned to them.

## Microsoft 365 Groups

Microsoft 365 Groups is a service that works with the Microsoft 365 tools you use already so you can collaborate with your teammates when writing documents, creating spreadsheets, working on project plans, scheduling meetings, or sending emails.

### Team collaboration

Groups in Microsoft 365 let you choose a set of people that you wish to collaborate with and easily set up a collection of resources for those people to share. Resources include a shared Outlook inbox, a shared calendar, or a document library for collaborating on files.

### Group permissions

You don’t have to manually assign permissions to all those resources because adding members to the group automatically gives them the permissions they need to the tools your group provides.

### Create groups

You can create Microsoft 365 Groups from various tools, including Outlook, Outlook on the web, Outlook Mobile, SharePoint, Planner, Teams, and more. Which tool you choose to start from depends a bit on what kind of group you're working with.
