Microsoft 365 is an extensible platform enabling developers and partners to create custom applications or extend and customize Office applications, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams.

## Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is an extensible platform you can create custom applications on, putting your app at the heart of your organization's collaboration platform. Apps for Microsoft Teams can be as simple or as complex as you need, from sending notifications to channels or users to complex multi-surface apps incorporating conversational bots, natural language processing, and embedded web experiences. You can build apps for an individual, your team, your organization, or for all Microsoft Teams users everywhere.

Some common scenarios that a custom Microsoft Teams app can help with are:

 -  Proactively send information to Teams from an external system, and allow users to take action on that information from inside the Teams client.
 -  Embed your website or web app directly in the Teams client.
 -  Allow users to quickly lookup information in another system and add the results to a conversation in Teams.
 -  Trigger workflows and processes based on a conversation in Teams, preserving the context of the conversation.

With the Microsoft Teams Platform, you can augment your services with context-specific information from the various Microsoft Teams APIs, such as information about the team or channel your app is installed in, or messages your app was triggered from.

The Teams Platform provides a rich and flexible set of extensibility points, UI constructs, and APIs for you to take advantage of while building your app. Your app can be as simple as embedding your existing website within a tab for your team, or a fully-featured, multi-faceted app engaging your users across the entire breadth of the Teams client.

## Extend Microsoft Office using Office add-ins

The Office add-ins platform enables you to extend the functionality of Office applications, including Word, Outlook, and Excel. Office add-ins provide several options for how your solution can interact with an Office application. In this unit, we discuss two of those options:

 -  Task pane
 -  Content

## Task pane add-ins

Task pane add-ins allow user interaction through a panel displayed within an Office application. Through the task pane interface, you can enable the user to modify documents or emails, view data from a data source, and more.

## Content add-ins

Content add-ins can be used to insert an object into an Excel spreadsheet or PowerPoint presentation. That object can be a web-based data visualization, media, or other external content.

The Office add-ins platform enables you to display a dialog for your users to:

 -  Sign into an integrated service, for example, authenticate with Microsoft Account, Google, or Facebook.
 -  Confirm the user's action.
 -  Run a task that might be too confined in a task pane, for example, view a video.

## Use the SharePoint Framework

SharePoint is an extensible platform you can customize and extend with the SharePoint Framework and the multiple APIs available to developers. The client-side development framework will deliver capabilities that will help both first-party and third-party developers build powerful, rich applications and provide an enjoyable web experience in Microsoft 365 for end-users that are both intuitive and simple to consume.

## SharePoint Framework

SharePoint Framework components are lightweight and run in both web and mobile experiences because they're client-side solutions. All the customizations you create and build are deployed and run through the browser. There's no server-side component in a SharePoint Framework component. The SharePoint Framework is backward compatible, meaning that it works not just the modern pages, but also on classic and publishing pages as well. The development tools and platform used in the SharePoint Framework is implemented with open-source tools and common JavaScript web frameworks like React.

## Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with your organization's data. The Microsoft Graph REST APIs implement many of the OData protocol’s query parameters. Query parameters will help you achieve multiple tasks such as limiting the amount of data returned by requests to Microsoft Graph, such as controlling how many fields are returned for each record, how many records are returned, also filtering and searching for necessary information. To support as many developers and platforms as possible, Microsoft Graph has two options for developers to choose from when integrating Microsoft Graph into their applications.

## Microsoft Graph REST API

At its core, Microsoft Graph is a REST API. That means that developers can use any platform, any framework, and any programming language they're most comfortable using.

## Microsoft Graph Native SDKs

Microsoft Graph also provides multiple native SDKs for developers who want to use a rich programming model within their applications. These SDKs abstract away the tasks of constructing, submitting, and processing the REST requests and responses with the Microsoft Graph REST API. You'll find an existing SDK for the platform and language you are working on as all the popular platforms covered, including .NET, iOS, Android, Java, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, and many more.
