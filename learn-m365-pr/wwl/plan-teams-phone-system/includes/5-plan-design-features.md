To use Phone System features, your organization must have a Phone System license. Once the license is active in your tenant, it provides the following features:

| **Feature**| **Description**|
| :--- | :--- |
| Cloud auto attendants| You can create a menu system that enables external and internal callers to locate and place or transfer calls to company users or departments in your organization.<br >Note that users *do not* need to be voice-enabled to receive calls from the auto attendant.|
| Cloud call queues| You configure how call queues are managed for your organization: for example, set up greetings and music on hold, search for the next available call agent to handle the call, and so on.<br >Note that users *do* need to be voice-enabled to receive calls from a call queue.|
| Music on hold| This plays default music defined by the service when an external call from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is placed on hold. This feature works for one-to-one PSTN-to-Teams calls in addition to calls made to a call queue. This feature provides on-hold notification parity with other platforms. This feature is configurable by the administrator but currently only via PowerShell. Hold music is also not supported in the consultative transfer of a PSTN call.|
| Call answer/initiate (by name and number)| This lets users answer inbound calls with a touch and place outbound calls either by dialing the full phone number or by selecting a name in the client.|
| Call forwarding options and simultaneous ring| This lets users set up forwarding rules so calls can be sent to any assigned telephone number, or calls can be forwarded to colleagues or voicemail.|
| Group call pickup and forward to a group| This lets users share incoming calls with colleagues so that the colleagues can answer calls that occur while the user is unavailable. This is less disruptive to recipients than other forms of call sharing (such as call forwarding or simultaneous ringing) because users can configure how they want to be notified of an incoming shared call.|
| Transfer a call and consultative transfer| This lets users transfer calls to another person. Or, if they need to leave their office but want to continue the conversation, they can transfer the calls from their PC or IP phone to their cell phone.<br >Consultative transfer allows for the user to talk to the person they want to transfer the call to.<br >Before the transfer is made, note that users *do not* need to be voice-enabled to receive transferred calls from another user.|
| Transfer to voicemail mid-call| This lets users transfer to voicemail during a call.|
| Call park and retrieve| This lets users place a call on hold in the Teams service in the cloud. When a call is parked, the service generates a unique code for call retrieval. The user who parked the call, or someone else, can then use that code and a supported app or device to retrieve the call.|
| Caller ID| Calls from inside the company display a detailed caller ID that pulls information from the corporate directory, showing picture ID, and job title instead of just a phone number. For calls from external phone numbers, the caller ID as provided by the phone service provider is displayed. If the external phone numbers are secondary numbers in the corporate directory, then the information from the corporate directory will be displayed.|
| Device switching| This lets users play a call or meeting on another HID device that is connected to Teams; for example, switching from their PC speakers to a headset.|
| Presence-based call routing| Controls inbound communications with presence, enabling the user to block all incoming communication except from those specifically indicated.|
| Integrated dial pad| This lets users dial by name or by number anywhere in the search bar and in the dial pad, speeding up the process of making outbound calls.|
| Federated calling| This lets users securely connect, communicate, and collaborate with users in federated tenants.|
| Make and receive a video call| If the user's account is enabled for video calls, the user can make face-to-face video calls with their contacts. All they need is a camera and a headset.|
| Cloud Voicemail| When a user receives a voicemail, it is delivered to their Exchange mailbox as an email with the voicemail message as an attachment. Users can listen to their messages on their certified desktop phone and on all Teams or Skype for Business applications. Support for voicemail transcription has been added as of March 2017 and is enabled by default for all organizations and users.<br ><br >Note that users do not need a Phone System license, nor do they need to be voice-enabled to use Cloud Voicemail features.|
| Cloud Voicemail user settings| This lets users configure their client settings for voicemail greetings, call answering rules, and greeting language, including out-of-office greetings.<br ><br >Note that users do not need a Phone System license, nor do they need to be voice-enabled to use Cloud Voicemail features.|
| Secondary ringer| Users with multiple speaker devices connected to their PC can choose to set a secondary device to ring in addition to their default speaker. For example, a user with a headset connected to the PC and desk speakers can choose to have both headset and desk speakers ring when a call comes in so that they don’t miss a call.|
| Distinctive ring alerts| Lets users choose separate ringtones for normal calls, forwarded calls, and delegated calls so they can distinguish the type of call.|
| Shared Line Appearance| This lets users share their phone line so that another user can make and receive calls on their behalf.|
| Busy on Busy (Teams only)| A calling policy that lets you configure how incoming calls are handled when a user is: in a call, in a conference, or has a call placed on hold. The caller will receive one of the following responses: hear a busy signal when the callee is on the phone, or will be routed accordingly to the user's unanswered settings. One option lets the caller leave a voicemail for the user who is already on a call.<br >The caller gets a missed call notification but isn't able to answer incoming calls. This feature is disabled by default but can be turned on by the tenant admin.|
| Call blocking| This lets users add (PSTN) phone numbers to a blocked list so that the next call from that number is blocked from ringing the user.|
| Common Area Phones| A common area phone is typically placed in an area like a lobby or conference room making it available to multiple people. Common area phones are set up as devices rather than users and can automatically sign into a network.|
| Media bypass support| For better performance, media is kept between the Session Border Controller (SBC) and the client instead of sending it via the Microsoft Phone System.|
