Exchange Online Protection (EOP) uses a multi-layered approach to protect users from various threats, including:

 -  phishing
 -  spoofing
 -  spam
 -  bulk email
 -  malware

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (formerly Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)) extends the protection provided by EOP by filtering targeted attacks that could pass through EOP’s line of defenses. These attacks include:

 -  advanced threats such as zero-day attacks in email attachments and Office documents.
 -  time-of-selection protection against malicious URLs.

When integrated together, EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 represent the anti-malware pipeline in Microsoft 365. These products provide the most efficient level of protection against commodity and advanced targeted threats.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is available with Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5. If your organization is using another Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscription, Microsoft Defender for Office 365 can be purchased as an add-on.
