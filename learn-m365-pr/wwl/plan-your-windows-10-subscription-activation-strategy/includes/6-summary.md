In the past, organizations had to activate Windows manually or set up an on-premises infrastructure for activation, such as the Key Management Service (KMS). This traditional process continues to work with Windows 10/11. However, Windows 10 version 1703 and newer includes a new capability, Subscription Activation.

This module introduced you to Subscription Activation, which enables an automatic, online upgrade from Windows 10/11 Professional to Windows 10/11 Enterprise. It also provides automatic activation when an Azure AD user with an assigned Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 or E5 license signs in. You learned how this activation happens with no keys and no reboots.

The module reviewed the benefits and advantages that Windows 10/11 Enterprise Subscription Activation has over traditional activation. With Subscription Activation, organizations no longer have to worry about activation keys. They just let Azure AD assign Windows 10/11 licenses to users or groups.

The module also examined how Azure AD is used for upgrading devices to Windows 10/11 Enterprise and for activation. Organizations no longer need to track used Windows 10/11 licenses, because Azure AD automatically tracks them. With Subscription Activation, organizations don’t need any on-premises activation infrastructure. Windows 10/11 devices can be activated wherever they are, as long as they have Internet connectivity.

In this module, you learned how to design a Windows 10/11 Subscription Activation strategy. This strategy covered three components:

 -  You began by exploring Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 availability through the Cloud Service Provider channel. Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP provides a flexible, per-user subscription for small- and medium-sized companies.
 -  You then learned how to configure Virtual Desktop Access (VDA) for automatic subscription activation on virtual machines. Users sometimes use Remote Desktop to connect to a remote Windows 10/11 computer. An example of this scenario is when users connect to Azure virtual machines. Users must have VDA rights to be allowed to connect to the remote Windows 10/11 computer. This module examined VDA in two scenarios - when organizations own their own virtual machines, and when their virtual machines are owned and hosted by another company.
 -  Finally, you analyzed the different ways to deploy Windows 10/11 Enterprise licenses. You learned how licenses can be obtained by an organization, how they can be assigned to users, and how they can be automatically deployed without device restart.
