Microsoft Secure Score is a security analytics tool. It's designed to help organizations understand what they've done to reduce the risk to their data. It also shows them what they can do to further reduce that risk. Secure Score determines what Microsoft 365 services an organization is using. It then looks at its configuration and behaviors and compares it to a baseline that's configured by Microsoft.

Rather than reacting or responding to security alerts, the Secure Score tool enables organizations to track and plan incremental improvements over a longer period of time.

In this module, you'll be introduced to the Microsoft Secure Score tool and its benefits.
