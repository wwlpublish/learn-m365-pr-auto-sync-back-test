You're planning to permit each of your users to install Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise on their personal computers. Each user will have a single Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise license. As you discuss the Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise functionality with your users, how many different devices will you tell each user they can deploy it on?"
    choices:
    - content: "2"

    - content: "5"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A single Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise license enables a user to deploy it on up to five different devices."
    - content: "8"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. That isn't the correct number of devices that a licensed user can deploy Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise on. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, you're planning the deployment of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise throughout the organization. You're going to allow each user to deploy it on their own devices. You're concerned, however, that your users may run into obstacles when running their own installations. Which of the following issues is a typical obstacle that prevents users from successfully deploying Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise?"
    choices:
    - content: "The user is running Windows Vista"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Windows Vista and later supports Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, but it's not supported on Windows XP and earlier. Try again."
    - content: "Time constraints"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There are no time constraints that prevent users from successfully deploying Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. Try again."
    - content: "Bandwidth limitations"

  - content: "You're the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, which has replaced its legacy Office apps with the Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise productivity suite. Tailspin has developed a large number of macros and add-ins to customize its Office apps to improve user productivity. As such, it's important that all new Office releases be thoroughly tested for compatibility before they're deployed throughout the company. In addition, Tailspin has selected devices that require extensive testing before rolling out new Office features to ensure they comply with regulatory and governmental requirements. Given Tailspin's extensive testing requirements, which of the following update channels should it use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Current Channel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Current Channel provides users with the newest Office features as soon as they're ready. Current Channel usually receives new features at least once a month, but there's no set schedule for when those updates are released. This schedule won't provide Tailspin with adequate testing time between releases. Try again."
    - content: "Monthly Enterprise Channel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While the Monthly Enterprise Channel supports monthly testing, it won't provide enough time to complete Tailspin's extensive testing requirements in between releases. Try again"
    - content: "Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This channel is recommended for select devices in your organization where extensive testing is needed before rolling out new Office features, especially when testing is required to comply with regulatory, governmental, or other organizational requirements."

    choices:
    - content: "Office Deployment Tool"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Office Deployment Tool uses xml to customize the deployment experience by enabling you to choose which applications to exclude and which language versions to include."
    - content: "Office Customization Tool"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can't use the Office Customization Tool (OCT) to update the configuration.xml file. Try again."
    - content: "Group Policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can use group policy to manage Office settings, but you can't use it to choose which applications to exclude and which language versions to include. Group Policy also doesn't use xml to customize the deployment experience. Try again."
