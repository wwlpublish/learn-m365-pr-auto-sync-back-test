The start of this module mentioned the old saying that you should "Plan your work and work your plan". With your Microsoft 365 deployment plan in place, this module examined the key tasks involved in configuring your Microsoft 365 tenant, specifically:

 -  Setting up your organizational profile
 -  Managing your tenant subscriptions
 -  Managing your services and add-ins
 -  Completing your tenant configuration

This module examined each of these tasks, each of which must be completed to successfully configure your Microsoft 365 experience.
