  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to implement Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Business-to-Business (B2B) collaboration. Azure AD B2B will enable Contoso to maintain control over its corporate data while securely sharing its applications and services with guest users from another organization. Holly wants to enable guest users to sign in to Contoso's apps and services with their own work, school, or social identities. What happens if a guest user doesn't have a Microsoft account or an Azure AD account?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Contoso admin with User Management permissions must create a Microsoft 365 account for the guest user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A Contoso admin with User Management permissions does not have to create a Microsoft 365 account for the guest user. Try again."
    - content: "An account is created for the guest user when they redeem their invitation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If the guest user doesn't have a Microsoft account or an Azure AD account, one is created for them when they redeem their invitation."
    - content: "Contoso must manage the external account and password of the guest user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. With Azure AD B2B, there's no external administrative overhead required by your organization. Try again."
  - content: "Microsoft Teams enables communication and collaboration with people outside of an organization. Which of the following methods is a way in which Teams can make that happen?"
    choices:
    - content: "External access (federation)"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Kerberos authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Kerberos authentication isn't a way in which Teams enables communication and collaboration with people outside your organization. Try again."
    - content: "OAuth 2.0 authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Consent Framework is built on OAuth 2.0 authentication. It's not a way in which Teams enables communication and collaboration with people outside your organization. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Northwind Traders, Patti Fernandez is concerned about data security when requesting support from Microsoft. If Patti needs a Microsoft support engineer to help troubleshoot and fix an issue, the engineer will have unlimited access to Northwind's data.

    choices:
    - content: "Create a DLP policy that provides limited access to the support engineer once a support case is opened"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. That's not what you should do to control the support engineer's access to your data. Try again."
    - content: "Require the support engineer submit a customer lockbox request"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Customer lockbox requests enable you to control whether to give the support engineer access to your data for a specified period of time."
