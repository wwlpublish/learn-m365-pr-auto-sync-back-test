Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Business-to-Business (B2B) collaboration enables an organization to maintain control over its corporate data while securely sharing its applications and services with guest users from another organization. This feature supports safe and secure collaboration with external partners, whatever their size, even if they don't have Azure AD or an IT department. A simple invitation and redemption process lets partners use their own credentials to access a company's resources. Developers can use Azure AD Business-to-Business APIs to customize the invitation process or write applications, such as self-service sign-up portals.

### Collaborate with any partner using their identities

With Azure AD B2B, the external partner uses its own identity management solution. This design provides the following benefits to an organization:

 -  Azure AD isn't required.
 -  There's no external administrative overhead required by an organization, which no longer has to:
    
     -  manage external accounts or passwords.
     -  synchronize accounts.
     -  manage account lifecycles.

### Invite guest users with a simple invitation and redemption process

Guest users sign in to an organization's apps and services with their own work, school, or social identities. If the guest user doesn't have a Microsoft account or an Azure AD account, one is created for them when they redeem their invitation. The process for inviting and redeeming a guest user includes:

 -  Invite guest users using the email identity of their choice.
 -  Send a direct link to an app, or send an invitation to the guest user's own Access Panel.
 -  Guest users follow a few simple redemption steps to sign in.

### Use policies to securely share your apps and services

Authorization policies can be used to protect an organization's corporate content. Conditional Access policies, such as multifactor authentication, can be enforced:

 -  at the tenant level.
 -  at the application level.
 -  for specific guest users to protect corporate apps and data.

### Easily add guest users in the Azure AD portal

Administrators can easily add guest users to their organization in the Azure portal. The process to add a guest user includes:

 -  Create a new guest user in Azure AD, similar to how a new user is added.
 -  The guest user immediately receives a customizable invitation that lets them sign in to their Access Panel.
 -  Guest users in the directory can be assigned to apps and groups.
