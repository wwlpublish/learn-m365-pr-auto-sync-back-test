    - content: "255 characters"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A host name is a user-friendly name that is associated with a host’s IP address and identifies it as a TCP/IP host. A host name can be no more than 255 characters in length. It can only contain alphanumeric characters, periods, and hyphens."
  - content: "Which DNS record type is used to resolve a host name with an IP address?"
    choices:
    - content: "MX record"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Mail exchange (MX) records are used to locate the mail servers responsible for a domain. Try again."
    - content: "A record"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "CNAME record"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Canonical name records (CNAME records) resolve to another host name, also referred to as an alias. Try again."
  - content: "A host name combines a domain name with what other object to create a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)?"
    choices:
    - content: "an alias"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An alias is a single name associated with an IP address. The host name combines an alias with a domain name to create the FQDN."
    - content: "a NetBIOS name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A NetBIOS name is a nonhierarchical name that some older apps use. It identifies a NetBIOS resource on a network, such as a single computer or a group of computers. Try again."
    - content: "a sub-domain name"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A subdomain name is a piece of additional information added to the beginning of a website’s domain name. It allows websites to separate and organize content for a specific function — such as a blog or an online store — from the rest of your website. Try again."

Before using this tool, you should be familiar with how DNS works. The nslookup command-line tool is available only if you have installed the TCP/IP protocol."
