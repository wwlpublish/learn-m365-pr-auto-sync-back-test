    choices:
    - content: "A team is deleted with a \"soft delete\" that IT can reverse for up to 30 days"

    - content: "Deleting a team removes any chats or content that was kept under compliance policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Deleting a team doesn't affect any chats or content that was kept under compliance policies. Try again."
    - content: "Deleting a channel won't delete the folder or its contents from the SharePoint document library"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Channels also have a \"soft delete\" and can be reversed for up to 21 days after deletion. Deleting a channel won't delete the folder or its contents from the SharePoint document library."
  - content: "Which identity model supported by Microsoft Teams requires a synchronized identity where the user password is verified by the on-premises identity provider?"
    choices:
    - content: "Federated identity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This model requires a synchronized identity where the user password is verified by the on-premises identity provider. With this model, the password hash isn't synchronized to Azure AD because Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) or a third-party identity provider is used to authenticate users against the on-premises Active Directory."
    - content: "Cloud identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In this model, a user is created and managed in Microsoft 365. The user account is stored in Azure Active Directory (AD) and only exists there. Try again."
    - content: "Synchronized identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In this model, the user identity is managed in an on-premises server, and the account and its password hash are synchronized to the cloud. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Admin for Northwind Traders, Allan Deyoung is implementing Microsoft Teams in Northwind's Microsoft 365 deployment. What must Allan do to enable Microsoft Teams for all of Northwind's users?"
    choices:
    - content: "Turn on all Microsoft Teams features at the individual user-level through the Teams admin center"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Specific Microsoft Teams’ features can't be turned on or off at an individual user level. Try again."
    - content: "Set the tenant-wide Microsoft Teams option in Org-wide settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There is no Microsoft Teams option in the org-wide settings. Try again."
    - content: "Assign an Office 365 Enterprise E3 or E5 license to each user"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When a license SKU such as Office 365 Enterprise E3 or E5 is assigned to a user, a Microsoft Teams license is automatically assigned to the user. This license enables the user to use Microsoft Teams."
