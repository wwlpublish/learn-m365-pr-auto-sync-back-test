In this module, you learned that Microsoft Teams is core to Microsoft's vision for intelligent communications. It brings together conversations, meetings, files, Office apps, and third-party integrations to provide a single hub for teamwork in Microsoft 365. To achieve its vision for intelligent communications, Microsoft has designed comprehensive calling and meetings capabilities into Teams, along with data and insights from the Microsoft Graph, and a strong roadmap of innovation to empower teams to achieve more.

This module described how Microsoft Teams is built on a new, modern infrastructure for enterprise-grade voice and video communications. Microsoft's next generation, cloud-born architecture is already powering communication experiences in Microsoft Teams, and is evolving rapidly. You learned that Teams provides both speed of innovation and higher-quality communication experiences.

You learned that Microsoft Teams can implement a Microsoft 365 group, a SharePoint Online site (complete with a document library), and an Exchange Online group mailbox. Teams uses these features to store information such as documents, videos, and other resources. A team can be created using existing Microsoft 365 Groups, allowing existing group memberships and contents stored in SharePoint Online and Exchange Online to be available within Teams.

You also learned that Microsoft 365 groups use identities stored in Azure Active Directory (AD). As such, all authentication capabilities in Azure AD, such as support for multi-factor authentication (MFA), are readily available for use by Teams.

The module concluded by examining how Microsoft 365's Phone System is the equivalent of the mobile phone. In other words, it provides functionality such as voicemail, but it doesn't give you a phone number or let you place or receive phone calls to or from the PSTN. For connecting Phone System to the PSTN—the equivalent of a contract with a phone provider—Microsoft offers Calling Plans. Calling Plans is an add-in to the Phone System feature in Microsoft 365. With Calling Plans, Microsoft provides each user a phone number that can be used to place and receive calls.
