SharePoint Online enables organizations to create their own independent, intranet site collections. An organization can have many intranet sites that are segregated or correlated depending on its needs. This design provides organizations with the total autonomy they need to create secure site collections.

Some of the different styles of sites that can be maintained in SharePoint Online include:

 -  Personal blogs
 -  Community
 -  Company Feed
 -  Site Feed
 -  Wikis
 -  Team sites
 -  Hub sites

### Permission levels

Permission levels play a major role, not only in creating separate sites, but in segregating and restricting access to content that's considered confidential or proprietary. These levels can be granular or hierarchical, depending on the company’s needs. The following table identifies the default permission levels in SharePoint Online.

Each of these permissions can be set for an item, folder, library, child site, and parent site for any guest or regular user in the company. When setting permissions, it's recommended that organizations use security groups to define where they want to restrict access. Setting permissions at the individual level can cause management problems when tracking individual access.

Another available permission level option includes setting an expiration date to access any of the options listed above. This option only allows a user a particular time frame in which to access the resource. Once that time has expired, the user no longer has access.
