## Microsoft Priva overview

Priva provides capabilities that help you:

* Proactively identify and protect against privacy risks such as data hoarding, problematic data transfers, and data oversharing
* Gain visibility into the storage and movement of personal data
* Empower employees to make smart data handling decisions
* Enable users to effectively manage data and take steps to comply with evolving privacy regulations
* Manage subject rights requests at scale
* Priva's capabilities are available through two solutions: Priva Privacy Risk Management, which provides visibility into your organization's data and policy templates for reducing risks; and Priva Subject Rights Requests, which provides automation and workflow tools for fulfilling data requests. You can choose to purchase one or both modules to suit your organization's needs.

## Privacy Risk Management

Privacy Risk Management in Microsoft Priva gives you the capability to set up policies that identify privacy risks in your Microsoft 365 environment and enable easy remediation. 

Privacy Risk Management policies are meant to be internal guides and can help you:

* Detect overexposed personal data so that users can secure it.
* Spot and limit transfers of personal data across departments or regional borders.
* Help users identify and reduce the amount of unused personal data that you store.
* Privacy Risk Management offers built-in templates for these scenarios to help you easily create policies. You can also fine tune your approach by creating custom policies, using any of these templates as a starting point.

## Subject Rights Requests

Several privacy regulations around the world grant individuals—or data subjects—the right to make requests to review or manage the personal data that companies have collected about them. 

These subject rights requests are also referred to as data subject requests (DSRs), data subject access requests (DSARs), or consumer rights requests. For companies that store large amounts of information, finding the relevant data can be a formidable task. Fulfilling the requests, for most organizations, is a highly manual and time consuming process.

The Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests solution is designed to help alleviate the complexity and length of time involved in responding to data subject inquires. We provide automation, insights, and workflows to help organizations fulfill requests more confidently and efficiently.
