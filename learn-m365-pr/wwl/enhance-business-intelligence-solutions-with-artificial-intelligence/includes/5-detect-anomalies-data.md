Anomaly detection helps you enhance your line charts by automatically detecting anomalies in your time series data. It also provides explanations for the anomalies to help with root cause analysis. With just a couple of clicks, you can easily find insights without having to slice and dice the data.

Besides detecting anomalies, you can also automatically explain the anomalies. When you select the anomaly, Power BI runs an analysis across fields in your data model to figure out possible explanations. It gives you a natural language explanation of the anomaly, and factors associated with that anomaly, sorted by its explanatory strength.
