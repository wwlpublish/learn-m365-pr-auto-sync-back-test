See at a glance how people within your organization are using different Microsoft 365 services. You need to have admin permissions to be able to view reports.

There are three types of reports:

 -  **Productivity score**. This score benchmarks work done in your organization compared to other organizations like yours.
 -  **Usage**. View usage by time period and Microsoft 365 service to understand how people in your organization are using Microsoft 365 services.
 -  **Security & Compliance**. View data about malware detections, targeted users, threat protection, encryption, etc.

You can use the pre-built dashboard to show cross-product usage. The dashboard also allows you to get more detail from several pre-built reports, and you can create custom reports.

You can also use Power BI with Microsoft 365 usage analytics to get more insight into how your organization is working. For more information, see [Enable Microsoft 365 usage analytics](/microsoft-365/admin/usage-analytics/enable-usage-analytics).

The Microsoft 365 admin center also gives you access to open separate admin centers for specific services, such as Exchange, Yammer, and others. To access the admin center, go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and sign in with your admin account. Alternatively, you can access the Microsoft 365 admin mobile app.
