In this module we looked at the reporting and analytics capabilities in Microsoft 365. We looked at the two analytic tools within Microsoft 365 that gather data and use AI to provide insights into working habits:

 -  **MyAnalytics** Lets you see how you spend your time at work and then suggests ways to work smarter.
