    - content: "Azure AD Conditional Access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This feature is the policy engine at the heart of Microsoft's Zero Trust solution. It uses authentication context to enforce even more granular policies based on user actions within the app they're using or sensitivity of data they're trying to access. This design helps organizations protect important information without unduly restricting access to less sensitive content."
