    - content: "Reducing the time criminals have to embed themselves into your environment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This strategy is actually part of automating your threat response. Try again."
    - content: "Reduce your attack surface area"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To make life harder for hackers, reduce your attack surface area by eliminating using older, less secure protocols, limiting access entry points, and exercising more significant control of administrative access to resources."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Adventure Works Cycles, Patti Fernandez wants to adopt a Zero Trust approach to security protection throughout the organization. Which of the following features is the policy engine at the heart of Microsoft's Zero Trust solution?"
    choices:
    - content: "Threat Analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Threat Analytics provides a set of reports from expert Microsoft security researchers that help you understand, prevent, and mitigate active threats. However, it isn't the policy engine at the heart of Microsoft's Zero Trust solution. Try again."
    - content: "Microsoft 365 Insider Risk Management Analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This feature can identify potential insider risk activity within an organization and help inform policy configurations. However, it isn't the policy engine at the heart of Microsoft's Zero Trust solution. Try again."
    - content: "Azure AD Conditional Access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This feature is the policy engine at the heart of Microsoft's Zero Trust solution. It uses authentication context to enforce even more granular policies based on user actions within the app they're using or sensitivity of data they're trying to access. This design helps organizations protect important information without unduly restricting access to less sensitive content."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Inc., Allan Deyoung wants to implement a Zero Trust security model across the organization.

    - content: "Azure AD Conditional Access wizard"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This wizard is not a valid tool that Fabrikam can use to determine where it is on its journey to implement a Zero Trust security model. Try again."
    - content: "Zero Trust Assessment"

    - content: "Microsoft Defender for Office 365"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 safeguards your organization against malicious threats posed by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools. However, it isn't the tool that can be used to help implement a Zero Trust security model. Try again."
