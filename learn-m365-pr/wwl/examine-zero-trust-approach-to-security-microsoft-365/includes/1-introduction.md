Today’s organizations need a new security model that effectively:

 -  adapts to the complexity of the modern environment.
 -  embraces the mobile workforce.
 -  protects people, devices, apps, and data wherever they're located.

The security model to support this modern reality is called Zero Trust. If there’s one thing that recent events have shown, it’s that security isn’t getting any easier. Recent high-profile breach activity has underscored the growing sophistication of today’s threat actors and the complexity of managing business risk in an increasingly connected world. It’s a struggle for organizations of every size and for the public and private sector alike. As organizations move into this next phase of digital transformation, with technology increasingly woven into our most basic human activities, the questions they must ask themselves as security defenders include:

 -  How do we help people to have confidence in the security of their devices, their data, and their actions online?
 -  How do we protect people, so they have peace of mind and are empowered to innovate and grow their future?
 -  How do we foster trust in a Zero Trust world?

As defenders ourselves, Microsoft is a passionate proponent of the Zero Trust mindset, encompassing all types of threats—both outside in and inside out. Microsoft believes the right approach is to address security, compliance, identity, and device management as an interdependent whole and to extend protection to all data, devices, identities, platforms, and clouds—whether those things are from Microsoft or not.

Microsoft is deeply inspired to enable people everywhere to do the important work of defending their communities and their organizations in an ever-evolving threat landscape. In this module, you'll learn about the concepts and principles of the Zero Trust model and how Microsoft 365 supports it.
