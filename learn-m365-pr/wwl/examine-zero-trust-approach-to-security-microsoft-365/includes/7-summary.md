In this module, you learned that today’s organizations need a new security model that effectively:

 -  adapts to the complexity of the modern environment.
 -  embraces the mobile workforce.
 -  protects people, devices, apps, and data wherever they're located.

This module introduced you to the security model that supports this modern reality, which is called Zero Trust. This module began by showing how security isn’t getting any easier. Recent high-profile breach activity has underscored the growing sophistication of today’s threat actors. These activities have also shown how complex it is to manage business risk in an increasingly connected world. It’s a struggle for organizations of every size and for the public and private sector alike.

This module showed how Microsoft is a passionate proponent of the Zero Trust mindset, encompassing all types of threats—both outside in and inside out. Microsoft believes the right approach is to address security, compliance, identity, and device management as an interdependent whole and to extend protection to all data, devices, identities, platforms, and clouds—whether those things are from Microsoft or not.

This module showed how Microsoft is deeply inspired to enable people everywhere to do the important work of defending their communities and their organizations in an ever-evolving threat landscape. You learn about the concepts and principles of the Zero Trust model and how Microsoft 365 supports it. This module covered the five steps to implementing a Zero Trust security model in your organization. It also examined Microsoft's story and strategy around Zero Trust networking.
