### Defender for Cloud Apps architecture

The Defender for Cloud Apps framework consists of the following features:

 -  **Cloud Discovery.** Discover all cloud use in your organization, including Shadow IT reporting and control, and risk assessment.
 -  **Data Protection.** Monitor and control your data in the cloud by gaining visibility, enforcing DLP policies, alerting, and investigation.
 -  **Threat Protection.** Detect anomalous use and security incidents. Use behavioral analytics and advanced investigation tools to mitigate risk and set policies and alerts to achieve maximum control over network cloud traffic.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps enables customers to discover and secure all the cloud apps in use within their organizations. Once the apps are discovered, customers can put comprehensive controls in place for management and monitoring. The architecture for how Defender for Cloud Apps accomplishes these goals is shown in the following diagram. Each of the numbered activities in this design is described below.

:::image type="content" source="../media/cloud-app-security-c3b98f88.png" alt-text="graphic showing how the architecture for how Defender for Cloud Apps enables customers to discover and secure all the cloud apps in use within their organizations.":::


The four activities identified in this diagram include:

1.  Users are going about their daily work and using cloud apps. Defender for Cloud Apps collects information from Microsoft 365 and Azure logs.
2.  Cloud traffic logs are analyzed by Defender for Cloud Apps to determine which apps are in use.
3.  An administrator reviews the apps and either sanctions or restricts them.
4.  The APIs of the cloud apps implement connections, controls, and ongoing monitoring for compliance and threat analysis. This process happens in a repeating cycle.

### Cloud Discovery

Cloud Discovery uses your traffic logs to dynamically discover and analyze the cloud apps that your organization uses. To create a snapshot report of your organization's cloud use, you can manually upload log files from your firewalls or proxies for analysis. To set up continuous reports, use Defender for Cloud Apps log collectors to periodically forward your logs.

### App connectors

App connectors use APIs from cloud app providers to integrate the Defender for Cloud Apps cloud with other cloud apps. App connectors extend control and protection. They also provide you with access to information directly from cloud apps, for Defender for Cloud Apps analysis.

To connect an app and extend protection, the app administrator authorizes Defender for Cloud Apps to access the app. The Defender for Cloud Apps then queries the app for activity logs, and it scans data, accounts, and cloud content. Defender for Cloud Apps can enforce policies, detects threats, and provides governance actions for resolving issues.

Defender for Cloud Apps uses the APIs provided by the cloud provider. Each app has its own framework and API limitations. Defender for Cloud Apps works with app providers to optimize the use of APIs and to ensure the best performance. Considering the various limitations that apps impose on APIs (such as throttling, API limits, and dynamic time-shifting API windows), the Defender for Cloud Apps engines use the allowed capacity. Some operations, like scanning all files in the tenant, require many APIs, so they're spread over a longer period. Expect some policies to run for several hours or several days.

#### Sanctioning and unsanctioning an app

You can use Defender for Cloud Apps to sanction or unsanction apps in your organization by using the Cloud app catalog. The Microsoft team of analysts has an extensive and continuously growing catalog of over 16,000 cloud apps that are ranked and scored based on industry standards. You can use the Cloud app catalog to rate the risk for your cloud apps based on regulatory certifications, industry standards, and best practices. You can then customize the scores and weights of various parameters to meet your organization's needs. Based on these scores, Defender for Cloud Apps lets you know how risky an app is based on over 70 risk factors that might affect your environment.

### Conditional Access App Control protection

The Conditional Access App Control feature uses reverse proxy architecture to give you the tools needed to have real-time visibility and control over access to and activities completed within your cloud environment. With Conditional Access App Control, you can protect your organization by:

 -  Avoiding data leaks by blocking downloads before they happen.
 -  Setting rules that force data stored in and downloaded from the cloud to be protected with encryption.
 -  Gaining visibility into unprotected endpoints so you can monitor what's being done on unmanaged devices.
 -  Controlling access from non-corporate networks or risky IP addresses.

#### Policy control

You can use policies to define your users' behavior in the cloud and detect risky behavior, violations, or suspicious data points and activities in your cloud environment. If needed, you can use policies to integrate remediation processes to achieve complete risk mitigation. Multiple types of policies correlate to the different types of information you might want to gather about your cloud environment and the types of remediation actions you might take.
