Data deletion occurs when an attacker deletes your data, usually in a way that makes recovery difficult, if not impossible. A variant of this type of attack includes ransomware. With ransomware, an attacker compromises the network, encrypts data, and then demands a payment to get the key to decrypt the data. This threat may result in data deletion since a successful extraction of payment often leads to more targeting by the attacker.

Attackers are motivated by various data deletion goals, including:

 -  Covering the tracks of an attack.
 -  Attempting to do irreparable harm to your business.
 -  Trying to spite you or your employees.

### Preventing data deletion

Organizations typically focus their initial data protection mechanisms on preventing account breaches and elevation of privilege. They should then enhance their core prevention strategy by ensuring they have sufficient redundancies built into their data management processes to minimize the impact of data deletion.

Data in Microsoft 365 is automatically backed up and made redundant for maximum availability by the service. That being said, it’s still possible for an attacker to delete data from SharePoint sites and recycle bins, making it almost impossible to recover. Given this threat, it’s critical that you employ a process for backing up critical data to offline stores that you know how to restore.
