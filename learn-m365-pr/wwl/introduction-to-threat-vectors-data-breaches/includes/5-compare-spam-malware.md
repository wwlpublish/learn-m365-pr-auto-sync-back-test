While spam and bulk email are often a nuisance, they typically don’t carry a payload that causes harm to a user’s system. They just get in the way of a user’s productivity.

But similar to spoofing, attackers have taken a typically innocuous feature such as spam and bulk email and turned it into an attack vehicle. In this case, it's malware, which can cause great harm to an organization. The term "malware" is short for "malicious software." It's often received in email as either an attachment or an embedded link to a malicious web site or file.

Malware typically works in two stages:

 -  **Stage 1**. The attachment or web site you visit that's infected. The malware then uses code to exploit a user’s computer using macros and JavaScript to plant a payload such as a virus or Trojan horse.
 -  **Stage 2**. Delivering the payload.

### Example of malware

To the untrained eye, the sample code in the image below looks harmless enough. However, the two lines at the bottom of the image force the user’s browser to be redirected to a malicious web site.
