This module examines how messaging administrators can create custom address lists, address book policies, email address policies, and offline address books.

All recipients in Exchange are included in address lists that are accessible to users from Outlook and Outlook on the Web. This module examines how address lists simplify the process of finding recipients in an organization. And because the global address list (GAL) for a large organization may contain thousands of recipients, Exchange enables them to create custom address lists that include users based on different criteria, such as geographical location or department.

This module also examines how Outlook users can download an offline copy of the address lists. This copy is known as an offline address book (OAB). An OAB enables a user who is running Outlook in cached mode to access the address book while disconnected from Exchange.

The module also explores how address book policies (ABPs) allow you to segment users and provide customized views of the organization's global address list. ABPs are used in scenarios when two separate companies work in a single Exchange organization, and each of those two companies need to access only their own address lists. ABPs may be also used in schools, where students in each class need to see only the other students in their own class, including the teacher and the principal.

Because many messaging systems host multiple SMTP domains, messaging administrators must manage the email addresses assigned to the Exchange recipients. Because each recipient must have the appropriate email addresses, you can configure multiple domains in Exchange Server and create and apply email address policies that define the email address’ format.
