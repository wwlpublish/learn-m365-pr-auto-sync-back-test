Power BI continues to be an industry leader in bringing insights into the real world through augmented reality. The updated Power BI for HoloLens app adds support for HoloLens 2 and makes it easier to view and interact with reports and dashboards in true, augmented reality. Users can get report pages and dashboards into mixed reality, and once they do, visuals exist there every time they open the app, updated in real time, and persisting until they choose to remove them.
