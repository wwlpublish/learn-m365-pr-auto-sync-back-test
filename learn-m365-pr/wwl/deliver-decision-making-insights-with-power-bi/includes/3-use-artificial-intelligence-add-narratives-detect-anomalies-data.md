## Smart narratives (preview)

Many times, we see users use PowerPoint, text boxes, interactive headers, or custom visuals to add narrative to their data.  All these options either lack interactive data, interactive and customizable text, or useful automatic insights. The Smart narrative visualization helps you quickly summarize visuals and reports by providing customizable and relevant out-of-the-box insights.

With Smart narratives, creators can add narratives to their report to address key takeaways, point out trends, and edit the language and format it to fit a specific audience. Instead of pasting a screenshot of their report in PowerPoint with key takeaways added, they can now add narratives to the report that are updated with every refresh. You can use the narratives to understand their data, get to the key points faster, and explain the data to others.

## Anomaly detection

Report authors will be able to add enrichments to visualizations to automatically find anomalies based on personalized parameters. Selecting an anomaly will trigger a further analysis that explains the anomaly for the end user. These explanations can be customized by the report author.
