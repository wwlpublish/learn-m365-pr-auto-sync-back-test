The world has fundamentally changed in 2020. Individuals have had to adapt to working digitally and independently. Teamwork and collaboration are done entirely through screens and entire organizations have become remote work forces.

How we share and consume data must transform as well. Since Power BI was made generally available over 5 years ago, our mission has been to help our customers drive a data culture, where every individual can make every decision better informed by data.

Power BI continues to advance the state of the art in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to help business users and business analysts extract insights from both structured and unstructured data. Power BI has a comprehensive set of AI capabilities in the industry – helping our customers analyze text and images, build automated machine learning models, interact with their data simply by asking questions, and automatically detect patterns in their data – all through highly interactive visual experiences.
