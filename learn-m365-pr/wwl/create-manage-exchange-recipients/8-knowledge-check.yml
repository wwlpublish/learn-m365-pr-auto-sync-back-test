    - content: "Microsoft 365 groups"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. These groups are available only in Microsoft 365 and provide team collaboration such as document storage, a centralized calendar, a OneNote notebook, working collaborative on project plans, and team email distribution in one space. Microsoft 365 groups are excellent for team or department collaboration that uses other resources such as a OneNote or OneDrive. Because Microsoft 365 groups provide hooks into multiple Microsoft 365 services, they can be used as a tool to aid adoption and drive business value."
