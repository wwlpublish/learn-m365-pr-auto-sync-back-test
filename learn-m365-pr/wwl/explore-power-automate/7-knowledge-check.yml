  questions:
  - content: "What do Power Automate flows require to start?"
    choices:
    - content: "An action"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Actions define the steps a flow will complete. They don't start a flow. Try again."
    - content: "A trigger"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. All flows require a trigger to start."
    - content: "A template"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Templates are used to create flows. They don't start a flow. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Northwind Traders, Patti Fernandez recently created a Power Automate flow. Patti later added another user as an owner of this flow. How will this action affect the flow?"
    choices:
    - content: "The flow will only show up under Team flows"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When a user adds another user or group as an owner of a flow, that flow becomes a team flow. As such, it only shows up under Team flows."
    - content: "The flow will become a Microsoft 365 group flow"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. That's not how the flow will be affected. Try again."
    - content: "The co-owners can create a new flow that uses the same connection as that flow"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Co-owners are limited to use the connection with that flow. They can't create a new flow and use the same connection. Try again."
  - content: "Which type of flows are triggered manually as needed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Instant flows"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Instant flows are triggered manually as needed. Instant flows are also referred to as button flows."
    - content: "Scheduled flows"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Scheduled flows are triggered by a schedule. The creator of the flow chooses when and how often the flow runs. Try again."
    - content: "Automated flows"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Automated flows are triggered by a chosen event. For example, a user may create a flow to notify you when an item is created or modified in a SharePoint list. Try again."
