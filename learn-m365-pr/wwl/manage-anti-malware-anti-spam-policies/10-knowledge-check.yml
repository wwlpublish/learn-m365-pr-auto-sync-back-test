  questions:
  - content: "Which anti-spam agent on Edge Transport servers uses an IP blocklist, IP allowlist, IP blocklist providers, and IP allowlist providers to determine whether a connection should be blocked or allowed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connection Filtering agent"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Connection filtering uses an IP blocklist, IP allowlist, IP blocklist providers, and IP allowlist providers to determine whether a connection should be blocked or allowed."
    - content: "Recipient Filter agent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Recipient filtering uses a recipient blocklist to identify messages that aren't allowed to enter the organization. The recipient filter also uses the local recipient directory to reject messages sent to invalid recipients. Try again."
    - content: "Sender Filter agent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Sender filtering compares the sending server to a list of senders or sender domains that are prohibited from sending messages to your organization. Sender Filter agents are also used on Mailbox servers and not Edge Transport Servers. Try again."
  - content: "Which anti-spoofing technology lets you add a digital signature to outbound email messages in the message header?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sender Policy Framework (SPF)"

    - content: "DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. DKIM lets you add a digital signature to outbound email messages in the message header. When you configure DKIM, you authorize your domain to associate, or sign, its name to an email message using cryptographic authentication. Email systems that get email from your domain can use this digital signature to help verify whether incoming email is legitimate."
    - content: "Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. DMARC doesn't add a digital signature to outbound email messages in the message header. Try again."

    - content: "In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Anti-malware policies can't be configured in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. Try again."
    - content: "In Exchange Online Protection"
