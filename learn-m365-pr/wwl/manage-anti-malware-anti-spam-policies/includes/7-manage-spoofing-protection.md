Spoofing is the term used for the creation of email messages with a forged sender address. Attackers use spoofing to convince the recipient that the email was sent by somebody else. The following technologies, all supported by Microsoft 365, ensure that your domain can't be spoofed by attackers:

 -  Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
 -  DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and
 -  Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)

### Configuring Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

Configuration for the SPF is identical for on-premises Exchange Server deployments, Exchange hybrid deployments, and Exchange Online only.

SPF is configured using a DNS TXT record for your public DNS domain. This design enables target mail servers to retrieve your SPF configuration information by doing just a normal public DNS lookup. Because SPF consists of simple TXT records in DNS, it's mandatory to use the following syntax on the TXT record:

```
v=spf1 <IP> <enforcement rule>
```

The following table identifies the different parts of an SPF record:

**-all** : Indicates hard fail. Recommended if you know all authorized IP addresses for a domain, or when using SPF only, without DMARC or DKIM.


**~all** : Indicates soft fail. Used when not all possible sending hosts are known. Also required if you're using DMARC with p=quarantine or p=reject.


**?all** : Indicates neutral. This option is used when testing SPF. It isn't recommended for live deployments.


  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::


For example, the default SPF TXT record for Exchange Online or Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is:

```
v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
```

By configuring the SPF DNS records in your environment, you raise your domain reputation significantly. As such, the mail addresses of your domain are much harder to spoof for malicious and phishing email senders.

> [!CAUTION]
> You should be careful when configuring SPF records in your live environment if you have complex mail flow scenarios, many different sending hosts for application emails, automatic forwarding, and so on. For example, if a server in your environment is sending mail with sender addresses from your environment, and this server isn't included in your SPF record, mail from this host will be flagged as a phishing attack with a spoofed sender address.

**Additional reading**. For more information, see [How Microsoft 365 uses Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to prevent spoofing](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/how-office-365-uses-spf-to-prevent-spoofing?azure-portal=true).

### Configure DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

DKIM adds an encrypted entry to the message header called the DKIM-Signature entry. When you forward a message, portions of that message's envelope can be stripped away by the forwarding server. Since the digital signature stays with the email message because it's part of the email header, DKIM works even when a message has been forwarded as shown in the following example.<br>

:::image type="content" source="../media/domain-key-identified-mail-example-1df72f92.jpg" alt-text="Diagram showing mail flow with DKIM":::


In this example, if you had only published an SPF TXT record for your domain, the recipient's mail server could have marked your email as spam and generated a false-positive result. The addition of DKIM in this scenario reduces false positive spam reporting.

> [!TIP]
> Because DKIM relies on public-key cryptography to authenticate rather than just IP addresses, it's considered a much stronger form of authentication than SPF. As such, it's recommended that organizations use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC in their deployments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Organizations are currently unable to configure DKIM using the native tools in Exchange Server. You can only configure DKIM when using Exchange Online or a hybrid deployment.

DKIM is one of the trio of Authentication methods (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) that help prevent attackers from sending messages that look like they come from your domain.

DKIM lets you add a digital signature to outbound email messages in the message header. When you configure DKIM, you authorize your domain to associate, or sign, its name to an email message using cryptographic authentication. Email systems that get email from your domain can use this digital signature to help verify whether incoming email is legitimate.

When using DKIM, a private key encrypts the header in a domain's outgoing email. The public key is published in the domain's DNS records, and receiving servers can use that key to decode the signature. DKIM verification helps the receiving servers confirm the mail is really coming from your domain and not someone spoofing your domain.

> [!TIP]
> DKIM is enabled by default for Microsoft 365 domains that are named &lt;**tenant>.onmicrosoft.com**. You only need to enable DKIM to any other domains that you've added to your Microsoft 365 tenant.

To enable signing DKIM for a domain in Microsoft 365, you must create two CNAME records.

:::row:::
  :::column:::
    **Host name**

    **Record type**
  :::column-end:::

  :::column:::
    selector1.\_domainkey.&lt;domain&gt;
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    CNAME
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    selector1-&lt;domainGUID&gt;.\_domainkey.&lt;initialDomain&gt;
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    3600
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
  :::column:::
    selector2.\_domainkey.&lt;domain&gt;
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    CNAME
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    selector2-&lt;domainGUID&gt;.\_domainkey.&lt;initialDomain&gt;
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    3600
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::


In this table, the &lt;domainGUID&gt; and &lt;initialDomain&gt; parameters are defined as follows:

 -  **domainGUID.** Can be taken from DNS MX record that points to Microsoft 365 (for example, **contoso-com**.mail.protection.outlook.com)
 -  **initialDomain**. Your default Microsoft 365 domain that's named &lt;tenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com (for example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com)

For example, the following two DNS records are required to enable DKIM for the domain **contoso.com**:

 -  First public DNS domain record:
    
     -  **Host name**: selector1.\_domainkey.contoso.com
     -  **Record type**: CNAME
     -  **Value**: selector1-contoso-com.\_domainkey.contoso.onmicrosoft.com.
     -  **TTL**: 3600
 -  Second public DNS domain record:
    
     -  **Host name**: selector2.\_domainkey.contoso.com
     -  **Record type**: CNAME
     -  **Value**: selector2-contoso-com.\_domainkey.contoso.onmicrosoft.com.
     -  **TTL**: 3600

You would then complete the following steps to enable DKIM for the domain:

1.  In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Show all**. Under the **Admin centers** group, select **Security** to open the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal.
2.  In the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Policies & rules**.
3.  On the **Policies & rules** page, select **Threat policies**.
4.  On the **Threat Policies** page, under the **Rules** section, select **DKIM**.
5.  On the **DKIM** page, select the domain you wish to configure.
6.  On the detail pane that appears for the selected domain, select the **Create DKIM key**s button.
7.  In the **Publish CNAMEs** pop-up window that appears, select the **Copy** button to copy the CNAMEs that are displayed in the window.
8.  Leave the detail pane open for the selected domain. Publish the copied CNAME records to your DNS service provider. On your DNS provider's website, add CNAME records for DKIM that you want to enable. Ensure the fields are set to the following values for each:

```
Record Type: CNAME (Alias)
> Host: Paste the values you copy from DKIM page.
Points to address: Copy the value from DKIM page.
TTL: 3600 (or your provider default)
```

9.  Return to the detail pane in the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal to enable DKIM. To do so, select the **Sign messages for this domain with DKIM signatures** toggle switch to change its status to **Enabled**. If you later wish to disable DKIM for the domain, navigate to this pane and select this toggle switch to change the DKIM status to **Disabled**.
10. Close the detail pane for the selected domain.

### Configure Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)

DMARC works like SPF with public DNS records. It's intended to give recommendations to the recipient about how to use SPF and DKIM for the recipient's domain. As such, it's available for all Exchange implementations. However, to use it, your MX record must point to Exchange Online because on-premises Exchange Servers are currently unable to use DMARC records.

Like the DNS records for SPF, the record for DMARC is a DNS text (TXT) record that helps prevent spoofing and phishing. DMARC TXT records validate the origin of email messages by verifying the IP address of an email's author against the supposed owner of the sending domain. The DMARC TXT record identifies authorized outbound email servers. Destination email systems can then verify whether messages they receive originate from authorized outbound email servers.

To configure DMARC for your SMTP mail domains, you must have a DNS TXT record configured by your Internet DNS provider for each domain. Each DNS TXT record should be configured per the following format:

```
\_dmarc.domain TTL IN TXT "v=DMARC1; pct=100; p=policy; ruf=failure\_report; rua=aggregate\_report; fo=failure\_option"
```

The following table describes the syntax used to format a DNS TXT record for DMARC.

:::row:::
  :::column:::
    **Syntax**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    **Example**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    **Description**
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
  :::column:::
    domain
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    Contoso.com
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    This parameter is the domain you want to protect. By default, the record protects mail from the domain and all subdomains. For example, if you specify \_dmarc.contoso.com, then DMARC protects mail from the domain and all subdomains, such as marketing.contoso.com and itdepartment.contoso.com.
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
  :::column:::
    pct=100
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    pct=100
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    Indicates how many messages, as a percentage, that must be checked. A value of 100 means every email must be checked.
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
  :::column:::
    policy
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    p=none
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

Specifies what policy you want the receiving server to follow if DMARC fails. You can set the policy to one of the following values:

 -  **None**. Monitor only the impact of implementing DMARC.
 -  **Quarantine**. Request that external mail systems quarantine mail that fails DMARC.
 -  **Reject**. Request that external mail systems not accept messages that fail DMARC.

**Important**: You can't effectively quarantine or reject mail by using DMARC unless you also implement SPF and DKIM.


  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
  :::column:::
    Failure report(optional)
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    ruf=mailto:fail@contoso.com
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

When specified, a message is sent every time an SPF, DKIM, or DMARC check fails.

**Caution**: Only use this option when investigating issues.


  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
  :::column:::
    Aggregate report(recommended)
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    rua=mailto:agg@contoso.com
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    When specified, a message including an overview report is sent once a day.
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
  :::column:::
    Failure Option(optional)
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    fo=0
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

Specifies which failure options will send a DMARC message:

 -  **0** \- Generate report if all authentication mechanisms fail.
 -  **1** \- Generate report if any authentication mechanism fails.

**Caution**: Only enable this option when investigating issues because it generates a large number of messages.
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::


For example, the following DNS record configured DMARC for the domain contoso.com and all subdomains just to monitor the impact of DMARC by using a "none" policy, and to send an aggregate report to agg@contoso.com:

```
\_dmarc.contoso.com 3600 IN TXT "v=DMARC1; pct=100; p=none; rua=mailto:agg@contoso.com; fo=0"
```

> [!TIP]
> As a best practice when implementing DMARC, you should start and configure your DMARC policy as None, measure the impact, and then consider moving to the more restrictive policies such as Quarantine or Reject.
