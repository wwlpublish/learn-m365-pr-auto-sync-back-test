Organizations migrate not only mailboxes to Exchange Online, but also PST files, public folders, and cross-tenant mailboxes. This module examined these advanced migration options.

The module began by examining how to plan for and complete a PST migration. You learned that you can use the PST Import tool in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to bulk-import PST files to Exchange Online mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. You can also use the Import tool to bulk-import documents and other data from your on-premises SharePoint Server organization to SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business sites.

This module then explored how to complete a public folder migration. You learned the differences in migrating legacy public folders (Exchange Server 2010 or earlier) and modern public folders (Exchange Server 2013 or later).

The module concluded by examining how to plan for a cross-tenant migration. A cross-tenant migration enables an organization to move mailboxes from a source to another tenant in the same Exchange online service. In this analysis, you also learned how to prepare source user objects for a cross-tenant migration.
