It's essential that Teams administrators know how to troubleshoot the Microsoft Teams client. The Teams client, the network, and any number of configuration issues in the Microsoft Teams admin center can disrupt an organization's users from effectively sending and receiving calls and participating in Teams meetings. For example, imagine your Teams meetings aren't available during an important board meeting where remote users are required to participate.
