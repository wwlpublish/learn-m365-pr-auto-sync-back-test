Azure Stream Analytics is a real-time analytics and complex event-processing engine that is designed to analyze and process high volumes of fast streaming data from multiple sources simultaneously. Patterns and relationships can be identified in information extracted from several input sources including devices, sensors, clickstreams, social media feeds, and applications. These patterns can be used to trigger actions and initiate workflows such as creating alerts, feeding information to a reporting tool, or storing transformed data for later use.

Stream Analytics can route job output to many storage systems such as Azure Blob storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Store, and Azure CosmosDB. You can also run batch analytics on stream outputs with Azure Synapse Analytics or HDInsight, or you can send the output to another service, like Event Hubs for consumption or Power BI for real-time visualization.
