Most organizations provide centralized, certified datasets for their users to build reports. These are either Power BI datasets or 3rd-party open datasets. Composite models allow authors to connect to these datasets, and either extend them with their own measures or combine them with other imported data (for example, Excel files). In this way, organizations can scale their enterprise datasets by allowing users to leverage them in more self-service scenarios. Authors can bring in their own local data sources while still leveraging the authoritative Power BI datasets created by 3rd-parties or others in their organization.
