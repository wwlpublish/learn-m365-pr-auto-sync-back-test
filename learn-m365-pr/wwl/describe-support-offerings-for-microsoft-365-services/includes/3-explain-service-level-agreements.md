It’s vital that organizations to know that the services they’re using are reliable and secure. This way, they can achieve peace of mind about the services they use on a daily basis. With Microsoft 365 services, your organization benefits from guaranteed levels of service, detailed in a legal agreement referred to as a Service Level Agreement. 

**Microsoft Online Services Level Agreement**

Microsoft details its commitment to provide and maintain agreed service levels for Microsoft 365 services through its [Microsoft Online Services Level Agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/service-level-agreement#microsoft-online-services-level-agreement). For example, Microsoft guarantees a 99.9 percent uptime average over each period of one month for services like Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Stream.

In addition to the Microsoft Online Services Level Agreement, your organization can also take advantage of Service Level Agreements with its Cloud Service Provider, that will also provide specific guarantees of service for Microsoft 365 services. Service Level Agreements will vary between Cloud Service Providers.

Microsoft’s Online Services Level Agreement introduces several concepts:

| Concept            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Incident**       | A set of events or single event that results in downtime.    |
| **Downtime**       | The definition of downtime depends on the relevant  service. For example, for Microsoft Teams, any period of time where users are  unable to initiate online meetings, see presence stats, or are unable to have  instant messaging conversations is considered downtime. Your downtime reduces  the total time your services are functional (your uptime). |
| **Claim**          | Your organization submits a claim to Microsoft  customer support, to raise information about an incident, the experienced  downtime, affected users, and share details about how you’ve already  attempted to resolve an incident. Microsoft is then responsible for  processing your claim. |
| **Service Credit** | If your claim has been successfully approved by  Microsoft, your organization will receive Service Credits as a percentage of  the total monthly fees your organization has paid for the month where you  experienced downtime. |

Microsoft is confident in its commitment to Service Levels. The percentage of Service Credit your organization can receive, is linked to your monthly uptime percentage:

| **Monthly  uptime percentage** | **Service  Credit** |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| < 99.9%                        | 25%                 |
| < 99%                          | 50%                 |
| <95%                           | 100%                |

For example, if downtime has resulted in a monthly uptime percentage lower than 95 percent, your organization could receive a 100% percent Service Credit.

Your organization should always review all Service Level Agreements and ask questions, including the following:

- If you are using a Cloud Service Provider, how does it determine service levels and whether they are achieved or not?
- Who is responsible for reports? How can your organization access reports?
- Are there any exceptions in the agreement?
- What does the agreement say about both unexpected and scheduled maintenance?
- What does the agreement say about what happens if your infrastructure goes down because of an attack? What about natural disasters and other situations outside of your control?
- Does the agreement cover non-Microsoft service or system failures?
- What are the limits to the Cloud Service Provider’s liability in the agreement?
