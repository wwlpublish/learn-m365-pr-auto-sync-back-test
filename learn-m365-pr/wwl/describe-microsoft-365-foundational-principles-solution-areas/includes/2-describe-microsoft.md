The expanding digital estate is a reality and companies must develop new digital capabilities to stay competitive and break down silos. Limited cyber security resources and skills result in overwhelmed and overworked teams. And an increasing portfolio of fragmented security point solutions can result in poor user experiences, and gaps in the armor. 

Microsoft’s trusted, public cloud is uniquely suited for this challenge due to our experience, innovation, and scale. By harnessing the power of Microsoft’s cloud, we offer customers a security solution that cuts through the complexity and siloed point solutions. We empower security teams to deliver a frictionless user experience so people can get their jobs done. 

We build our technology based on these three foundational principles:

* Built-in experiences that work across platforms.
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation to secure your future.
* Integrated across people, devices, apps, and data.

## Built-in experiences that work across platforms 
Microsoft provides a built-in approach to security that provides simplified experiences for users and admins from any device, from anywhere, on any platform. 

We’ve created built-in multi-factor authentication, passwordless sign-on, and single sign-on so people can have only one set of protected credentials. These credentials work seamlessly access everything they need without interrupting their workflows. A unified security platform not only helps improve end-user productivity, it also helps to deliver coverage across your entire environment. 

We help to extend intelligent access policies to your corporate resources and give end users the consistent, frictionless experience they demand. This empowers IT admins to uniformly manage access to resources and enforce governance controls, regardless of platform. 

## AI and automation to secure your future 
With more than 8 trillion threat signals processed daily, our advanced machine learning delivers best-in-class intelligence. This accelerates our ability to understand the full scale of larger attacks by employing AI and automation to link together individual signals, which then correlate related events to provide important context. Detection is critical. However, it’s equally important to end the attack before any damage occurs. That’s why we’ve invested in automation that works with accuracy and velocity. 

Microsoft security tools arm your security team with ever-evolving cloud-scale AI to cut through the noise and eliminate repetitive tasks. That means they can focus on what matters with speed and accuracy.  

## Integrated across people, devices, apps, and data 
Microsoft’s integrated security solution is built to deliver comprehensive coverage across your entire environment such as endpoints, email, clouds, identities, networks, and IOT devices. From application security to Zero Trust and everything in between, we don’t just offer unparalleled breadth, we also bring depth. 

With Microsoft security products, you can take advantage of our integration of breadth and depth by gaining full visibility and control over your threat landscape. We’ve built our products and services to share important threat data with each other, enabling them to automatically correlate data and deliver contextual alerts for more effective threat detection and response. 

Our built-in approach to security delivers a simplified experience for end-users across platforms. This ensures that everyone can get their job done securely regardless of where they work and which tools they use.
