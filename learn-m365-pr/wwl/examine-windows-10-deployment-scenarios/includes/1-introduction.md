Windows as a Service (WaaS) is a servicing model that was introduced with Windows 10. WaaS replaced the traditional deployment model and operating system release cycle of several years with a much faster cadence of six months. Although new Windows client versions are released twice per year, you don't need to upgrade your devices that often. Each Windows client version is supported for 18 months, and you must upgrade it during that time.

Windows 10 and later upgrades are also known as feature updates. Besides these feature updates, Microsoft also releases quality updates. Quality updates don't introduce new features. They're released monthly, on every second Tuesday. Microsoft has aligned Windows 10 and later updates with Microsoft 365 and Configuration Manager updates.

In this module, you'll examine the servicing model for Windows as a Service, and how to plan for it in your organization. You'll also review the various deployment models for Windows 10 and later, including:

 -  Modern deployment
 -  Dynamic deployment
 -  Traditional deployment

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Explain how the Windows as a Service model continually provides new capabilities and updates while maintaining a high level of hardware and software compatibility.
 -  Explain how the modern deployment model combines both traditional on-premises and cloud services to deliver a streamlined, cost effective deployment experience.
 -  Explain how the dynamic deployment model can transform the existing version of Windows 10 and later that's included on a device to a customized version that is used in your company without reinstalling Windows.
 -  Explain how the traditional deployment model is image-based and uses an organization’s on-premises infrastructure.
