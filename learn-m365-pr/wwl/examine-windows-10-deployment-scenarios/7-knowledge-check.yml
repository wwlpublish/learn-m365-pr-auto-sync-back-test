  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Northwind Traders, Allan Deyoung wants to update all the company's Windows 10 devices, which already have Windows 10 preinstalled. Allan wants to customize them to adhere to company policy without reinstallation. Which of the following deployment options should Allan use given the current state of Northwind's devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "In-place upgrade"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This deployment option is used when devices are running one of the previous supported Windows client operating system. Try again."
    - content: "Migration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This deployment option is used when devices are running one of the previous supported Windows client operating system. Try again."
    - content: "Windows Autopilot"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When the devices already have Windows 10 preinstalled and you want to customize it to adhere to company policy without reinstallation, use provisioning or Windows Autopilot. Windows Autopilot is considered the modern way of deploying Windows 10."
  - content: "Lucerne Publishing recently purchased a dozen new Windows 10 laptops from its local hardware vendor. When the users turn on these new computers, the Out of Box Experience (OOBE) setup phase occurs. In this phase, Windows performs several tasks, such as asking for the keyboard layout and EULA acceptance. Of all the OOBE setup phase tasks, which one is unacceptable for many companies because it can cause serious problems?"
    choices:
    - content: "Windows asks if the computer should be joined to AD DS or Azure AD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is a standard Windows configuration settings prompt that doesn't cause issues with companies. Try again."
    - content: "The user is automatically assigned to the local Administrators group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The OOBE setup phase automatically assigns the user to the local Administrators group. This assignment is unacceptable for many companies because it can cause serious problems. For example, users with local admin rights can install/uninstall any software or modify the configuration of the system in such a way that could damage the system."
    - content: "Windows asks about the privacy settings to be used"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is a standard Windows configuration settings prompt that doesn't cause issues with companies. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer has several older devices running Windows 8.1 that the company wants to refurbish and redeploy to its warehouse staff. Because the previous users of these devices had downloaded unapproved and unlicensed software, Holly plans to wipe the hard disks clean and redeploy the devices without preserving any existing data. Which deployment method should Holly use to deploy the latest version of Windows 10 on these devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "In-place upgrade"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This deployment option is used when devices are running one of the previous supported Windows client operating system. However, it reserves existing settings, while Holly plans to wipe the hard disks clean. Try again."
    - content: "Bare metal deployment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Organizations can use this scenario when they have to deploy a new device that doesn't have a previous operating system (bare metal). It can also be used when they want to wipe and redeploy a device without preserving any existing data."
    - content: "Dynamic deployment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Dynamic provisioning enables organizations to transform the existing version of Windows 10, which is included on a device, to a customized version that's used within the company. Try again."
