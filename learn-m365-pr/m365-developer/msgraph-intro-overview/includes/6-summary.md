Microsoft Graph provides a unified API that can be used to access data and intelligence stored throughout your organization in various services, such as:

- Microsoft 365 services
- Enterprise Mobility + Security services
- Windows 10 services
- Dynamics 365 Business Central services

In this module, you saw that data from these services can be pulled into custom applications. This type of app allows salespeople to access:

- Previous emails
- Meeting notes
- Previous chats
- Employees who can help with customer support

Salespeople can retrieve this data by calling a single endpoint, as opposed to learning many individual service-specific APIs.

By using Microsoft Graph, you can enhance new or existing applications and automate workflows. You can also increase efficiency and productivity by tapping into data that employees need. You can include this type of data and intelligence in your own custom applications by calling Microsoft Graph REST APIs or using client libraries. As a result, you can focus on building key app features while integrating organizational data that helps employees be successful.
