The Microsoft Graph Toolkit components provide a prebuilt UI that looks and feels like other Microsoft 365 experiences. These web components can be used with the provided design directly in your app.

If you want to match your branding with components and change the way they look or the type of data that's shown, you can customize the components by using attributes, CSS custom properties, and templates.
