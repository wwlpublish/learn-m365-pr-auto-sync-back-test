  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary difference between single tenant apps and multi-tenant apps?"

    - content: "Single tenant apps reserve the name of the app across all Azure AD directories, while the name of multi-tenant apps can be used in multiple Azure AD directories."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct because the name of the registered application has no impact on if an app is single or multi-tenant."
    - content: "Single tenant apps can only be used in one tenant while multi-tenant apps can be copied into multiple Azure AD directories."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct because multi-tenant apps cannot be copied across Azure AD directories."
    - content: "Single tenant apps allow only users from the app's directory to sign in, while multi-tenant apps support users multiple tenants to sign in and use the app."
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "What is the key difference between an application and a service principal?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Proceed to the next unit in the module."
    - content: "Application objects are templates that exist in every directory where an application is used. They're used to create service principals that can be customized in each directory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct, because an application object only exists in the directory where the application is created."
    - content: "Service principals exist in the directory where the application is created, where application objects exist in each Azure AD tenant where the application is used."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct because the application and service principal objects are reversed in this answer."
