  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements about ID tokens is correct?"
    choices:
    - content: "ID tokens contain basic identity information about the currently logged in user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct, ID tokens are provided upon request when a user signs in. They contain basic identity information about the user, saving the application from having to issue another request for this information."
    - content: "ID tokens can be submitted in an authentication request to prove the identity of the user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "ID tokens aren't created and submitted to prove identity, they're supplied by the identity provider upon a successful sign-in by the user."
    - content: "ID tokens include both identity information and the permissions a user has been granted to an application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "ID tokens only contain basic identity information; they don't contain any application permission information."
  - content: "Which of the following statements about access tokens is incorrect?"
    choices:
    - content: "Access tokens can be created by Azure AD either for a user or for an application."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Depending on the permission and the OAuth 2.0 flow implemented, Azure AD can create either access tokens for a user or for an application to use."
    - content: "Azure AD supports multiple OAuth 2.0 flows that developers can use to obtain an access token."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Developers can choose from multiple OAuth 2.0 flows supported by Azure AD depending on the type of application and the one that best fits the user scenario."
    - content: "Access tokens are submitted by the application to the identity provider to request permissions to a resource on behalf of a user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Access tokens aren't submitted by an application, they're provided by the identity platform."
