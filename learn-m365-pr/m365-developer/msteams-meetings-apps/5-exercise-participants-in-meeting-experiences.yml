  title: Exercise - In-meeting experience & participant roles
  description: In this exercise, you'll implement the in-meeting experience for the meeting and improve the existing pre-meeting experience. In the pre-meeting experience, organizers can approve and modify the presentations submitted by other meeting participants. In addition, the in-meeting experience will display a different experience depending on if the participant is a presenter, organizer, or attendee of the meeting in the side panel of the meeting.
