  title: Exercise - Understand throttling in Microsoft Graph
  description: In this exercise, you'll create a new Azure AD web application registration using the Azure Active Directory admin center, a .NET Core console application, and query Microsoft Graph. You'll issue many requests in parallel to trigger your requests to be throttled. This application will allow you to see the response you'll receive.

quiz:
  title: Check your Microsoft Graph throttling knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What does it mean when a request is throttled by Microsoft Graph?"
    choices:
    - content: "An application has issued more than the allowed request quota for the tenant and needs to wait for the quota to reset."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Each resource accessible via Microsoft Graph implement their own logic to determine if requests should be throttled. There's no single request quota Microsoft Graph monitors."
    - content: "Microsoft Graph is in an unhealthy state and the requester should try their request again later."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A throttling response is indicated by an HTTP status code 429 and can be handled by an application by retrying the request after a period of time. The HTTP status code 503 indicates Microsoft Graph service is in an unhealthy state and there's nothing the requestor can do to avoid the response as it isn't indicative "
    - content: "Microsoft Graph has determined the number of requests submitted by an app is excessive and could impact the service's overall health. Throttling is how Microsoft Graph tells the requester to reduce the number of requests to an acceptable level over a period of time."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following statements about the HTTP header Retry-After isn't true?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Retry-After header value instructs the requestor the date and time when to resubmit their request."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This statement isn't correct. The Retry-After header value isn't a timestamp; its the number of seconds the requestor should wait before resubmitting the request."
    - content: "The Retry-After HTTP header instructs the requester to not resubmit the request before the specified number of seconds has elapsed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is true. The Retry-After value is the number of seconds the requester should delay resubmitting the request to Microsoft Graph."
    - content: "The Retry-After header may or may not be included in every throttling response from Microsoft Graph."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement is true. Not all resources supported by Microsoft Graph include the Retry-After HTTP header in a response when the request is throttled. In these cases, the application should have a default delay it uses before resubmitting the request."
  - content: "What will happen if an application resubmits a request before the specified Reply-After HTTP header value?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Graph will continue to throttle the request and provide a new Request-After header value."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Proceed to the next unit in the module."
    - content: "Microsoft Graph will disable the requesting application and an administrator will need to manually reactivate it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct, applications will not be disabled by Microsoft Graph."
    - content: "Microsoft Graph will process the request and respond with the results because the Retry-After HTTP header value is only a suggestion."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct, any request resubmitted before the specified delay time in the Retry-After header will continue to be throttled."
