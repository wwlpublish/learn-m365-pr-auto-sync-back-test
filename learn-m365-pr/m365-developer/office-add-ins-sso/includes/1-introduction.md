Single Sign-On (SSO) provides a seamless way for your add-in to authenticate users. Using this method, your add-in can authenticate the user to retrieve identity information or to obtain from another secured endpoint such as Microsoft Graph. To do this, your add-in must call a server-side web API that's registered with Azure AD.

In this module, you'll learn how to implement SSO for your Office Add-ins.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of REST services & APIs
- Basic knowledge of Microsoft Graph
- Ability to program with JavaScript and Node.js
- Experience using Visual Studio Code at the beginner level

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand how Office Add-ins can use SSO to call Microsoft Graph
- Create Word add-in that uses SSO to call Microsoft Graph
- Create an Excel add-in that uses SSO to call Microsoft Graph
