**Microsoft Graph** provides a unified programmability model that you can use to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with the data of millions of users. Microsoft Graph APIs implements many of the OData protocol’s query parameters. In this module, you'll learn how to manipulate queries using query parameters.

Query parameters will help you achieve multiple tasks such as limiting the amount of data returned by requests to Microsoft Graph such as controlling how many fields are returned for each record, how many records are returned, also filtering and searching for wanted information.

This module will also cover other query parameters that can be used for combining multiple requests in a single HTTP request. Combining requests is done by leveraging batching and expanding related items to avoid additional HTTP round-trips to Microsoft Graph.

## Prerequisites  

- Basic knowledge of REST services and APIs
- Ability to develop with ASP.NET Core at the intermediate level
- Experience using Visual Studio Code at the beginner level
- Access to a [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program?ocid=MSlearn)
  
## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:  

- Demonstrate how to manipulate REST queries with query parameters
- Create queries that expand complex entities
- Demonstrate how to search for content with Microsoft Graph
- Optimize Microsoft Graph queries with batching
