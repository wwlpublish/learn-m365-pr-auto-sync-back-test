Tabs are Microsoft Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. They can be added as part of a channel or a group chat inside a team or as a personal app for an individual user. As part of your app, you can add custom tabs to embed your own web content in Teams. In this module, you'll learn how to create tabs and add them to your Microsoft Teams app.

There are two types of tabs available in Teams: channel/group and personal. A channel or group tab delivers content to channels and group chats. A channel/group tab is a great way to create collaborative spaces around dedicated web-based content. Personal tabs, along with direct conversation bots, are part of personal apps and are scoped to a single user. They can be pinned to the left pane and promote increased productivity by making your service available directly inside the Teams client.

In this module, you'll learn how to create both types of tabs for use within Microsoft Teams.
