The Microsoft identity platform enables developers to build many different types of applications to satisfy diverse business requirements and different scenarios. By supporting multiple OAuth 2.0 standard authentication protocols, developers can create different types of applications that meet business needs including single-page applications, web apps, mobile or native apps, and services or daemon apps.

In this module, you'll learn how you can implement different OAuth 2.0 protocol grant types (flows) in popular application types.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of OAuth authentication flows and terminology
- Ability to develop with ASP.NET Core at the intermediate level
- Ability to develop with JavaScript or TypeScript at the intermediate level
- Experience using Visual Studio Code at the beginner level
- Access to a [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program?ocid=MSlearn)

## Learning objectives

1. Compare and contrast different grant types (flows) in the OAuth 2.0 protocol
1. Evaluate which authentication protocol to use based on the app scenario
1. Implement different authentication protocols in different application types
