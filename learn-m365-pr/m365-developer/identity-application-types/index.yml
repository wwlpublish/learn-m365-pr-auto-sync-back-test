title: Application types in Microsoft identity
summary: The Microsoft Identity platform enables developers to build many different types of applications to satisfy diverse business requirements and different scenarios. By supporting multiple OAuth 2.0 standard authentication protocols, developers can create different types of applications that meet business needs including single page applications, web apps, mobile or native apps, and services or daemon apps. In this module, you’ll learn how you can implement different OAuth 2.0 protocol grant types (flows) in popular application types.
