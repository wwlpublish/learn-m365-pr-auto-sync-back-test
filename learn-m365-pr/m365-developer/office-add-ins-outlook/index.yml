title: Build Office add-ins for Outlook
summary: Microsoft Office clients enable developers to create add-ins that extend Microsoft Outlook with custom functionality. Through a JavaScript API, developers can access and edit the contents in an email or calendar event in Outlook from an app running in the client. In this module, you'll learn how to build an Outlook add-in that will render buttons in the compose message window, implement a button that invokes a function, and implement a task pane that inserts content into the body of a message.
